         " I just paid for my membership.It's unbelievable.It's absolutely unbelievable.And for those that aren't members and took a road trip, they say that's the most unbelievable thing.I now understand everything you've been talking about.I'm going to sign up.The road trip is the most mind-changing, life-altering event that we've ever created.Because until you can see it, feel it, touch it, and even smell it, the difference between good deals, bad deals, and so forth, then you're really not going to be able to get there.All right, so you want to get in?Get signed up for all that stuff.Next, let's talk about the second way real estate is different.Real estate has cash flow. And I don't know how to make this any clearer than to just scream it at the top of my lungs saying, look, you can't retire till you have cash flow.Most people think the way you retire is you build up a pile of money and then you try to live off of it and your goal is to die before the pile runs out.That's not what you do.I've been retired since I'm 34 years old. And I plan on staying retired until I'm 134 years old.You understand?It doesn't matter.I will have income for the rest of my life, however long I live.And I hope to live a long time. So what's the difference?Well, when you had a 401k, I had a 401k.It didn't pay me anything.In fact, I had to pay money into it.I used to be upset, to say the least, that money came out of my check to put it into a 401k, but they convinced us all we should do it.It was dumb as a rock.Never saw the money.Still got taxed on it, too, by the way.You don't realize when you put money into a 401k, you're still paying Social Security and Medicare tax on it.You haven't even got the money, and you're paying taxes on it. Wacko thing.IRA, somebody convinced me to put some money in an IRA once.I think it was my dad.Didn't pay me anything.I put money into it.It didn't pay me.Terrible investment.Somebody said the most important investment you'll ever make in your life is your home.And that you should strive diligently to pay off your home.I think it was Robert Kiyosaki or something like that.And that's just ridiculous.Because my home never paid me any cash flow. Now, I owned houses that paid me cash flow, but my personal residence didn't pay me cash flow.So there was no reason to pay it off and have all that money tied up in that house.Car collections never paid me any money.Motorcycle collections never paid me any money.I have a tool collection, it doesn't pay me any money.I have a gym I built, it doesn't pay me any money. All the things that I put money in in my life, only my real estate investments pay me money, except my savings accounts.So when you think about it, how do you retire?The way you retire is you build up enough passive income to replace your earned income.That's the only way you retire at 34 years of age or at 44 years of age or at 54 years of age or at 64 years of age. Now, at 74, you can just quit and be broke.You can retire broke.You can retire on Social Security and live like an impoverished imp.But that's not what I wanted to do.I wanted to retire and have the money to go places and do things.I just got back from Italy and France.We spent a couple weeks there.And that was fun.And I could afford to pay for it. You don't want to retire and be broke.You need cash flow.And you can't really retire early unless you have cash flow, because you don't have enough money to survive.Most people that join Lifestyles, it happens right after they go visit their financial planner, and the guy goes, okay, you got $200,000, $300,000, and you make 100 grand a year, so you could last three years.Then you're broke. So you can't retire.It won't work.System doesn't work.You have to have cash flow to retire.I just can't say it loud enough.I can't say it long enough.I can't make it clear.Now, start with a rent house.Maybe you only make $500 a month positive cash flow on the first one.But do you have $500 a month coming in the mail to you every single month?Put it in your pocket, 500 bucks. I remember the first time I got my first checks, I'm like, man, this is incredible.I didn't work for this.Then you get a thousand and then went from a thousand to 2000.You follow what I'm saying?It just gets better and better and better and better.I remember when I got to $5,000 a month ago, you know what?That's more than what I take home from my job.I was making 70 grand a year. And by the time you take out taxes, insurance, 401K, blah, blah, blah, I was only taking home $3,000 a month.$3,000, $3,500, something like that.Now all of a sudden I'm making $5,000 a month.And by the way, one of the other reasons real estate is so important is because it was tax-free, which made that $5,000 worth a lot more.Well, the $3,500 was after tax.So you see, it only would have taken $3,500 to replace what I was taking home. But I was making $5,000, so I was making more.So cash flow, guys, is the second thing.Now, we'll add on top of that very quickly before we go to break the third thing, which is principal reduction.You've got a mortgage on that house.If you've done it right, you've got a mortgage on that house. And your tenant is paying the mortgage.You're not paying the mortgage.That $500 a month positive cash flow or $1,000 or $5,000 is after the mortgage is paid.The more mortgages you have, the more money your tenants are paying for you to pay off that mortgage. And at some point, the principal reduction in this thing, and let's reduce this to the ridiculous.If it's a 30-year mortgage and you held it for 30 years, which wouldn't be our model, but if you did, 30 years from now, let's say you bought $2 or $3 million worth of real estate, it would have doubled in value and the mortgages would be paid off.That's the beauty of this stuff. And that's why you need to get into real estate.We'll take a short break.Be right back with the Dell Walmsley Radio Show. teaching you with a roadmap to creating the lifestyle you really want.Keep listening.The Del Wamsley Radio Show returns in moments.

Welcome back to the Del Wamsley Radio Show.Today we're discussing how real estate makes you money in five different ways, okay?Sometimes six, and I'm going to cover what the sixth one is also.But I want you to understand the premise here is that most investments only have one, possibly two, ways that they make you money.And if that one way isn't working, the other way, there's no other way.You're not making any money. Also, when you take the fact that there's five different ways, these five different ways are all leveraged in real estate when done correctly.And that means the growth is astronomically better than just straight up putting money into something, any type of investment when you pay cash for it.So let's take a look at the next one and give you an example is appreciation. The misrepresentation that they try to play with you out there with the stockbroker guys and to just try to put real estate down.Because, by the way, every stockbroker guy I know owns real estate.That's everyone I know.Now, maybe I only know a certain type of stockbroker, but everyone I know owns real estate because they know that real estate makes more money than stocks do.All right.So let's talk about that. Let's talk about appreciation and the myth that they tried to bestow upon you.They tell you the stock market grows at some rate, whatever rate.I'm going to make up a rate.Let's say it grows at 5%.Some of them might tell you it grows at 10%.Some might say it grows at 12%.Whatever that is, that's fine.Let's let them make that statement.And whether or not that's true over the long haul, I don't know.I'm just going to assume it is.I'm assuming that they're being honest. But what they're trying to tell you is disingenuous is they're saying that real estate appreciates at something like 3%, 4%, or 5%.Now, first of all, just on the face of it, some subdivisions appreciate as high as double digits, 15%, 16% I've seen.And other ones don't appreciate any more than that.But if the average is 5% or 6% or whatever, that's fine except for this point.We're not paying cash for that house. We're not paying cash for that apartment.So if I buy a house and it's a $100,000 house, I'm just making up numbers here you can follow on the radio.And if I buy it for $100,000 and I put 10% down because we're not putting 20% down with our hard money lending situation.We're putting down anywhere from zero to probably 10% overall in the whole thing.In other words, if we have a $200,000 house, we don't have more than 20, 25,000 in it.So let's just say on average 10%. If I have 10% down on that house and that house goes up 5%, it goes up $5,000 in value.Well, $5,000 is not based on the $100,000.It's based on the $10,000 I have invested.If it goes up $5,000 on my $10,000 invested, I've made a 50% gain.So let's talk about this. If it only goes up 3%, that's a 30% gain.If it goes up 4%, that's a 40% gain.If it goes up 5%, it's a 50% gain.If it goes up 16%, that's a 160% gain compared to the stock market they're claiming is 10% or 12% or whatever they're claiming.It's not even close.It's at least double the rate of return on this appreciation.Now, when you add principal reduction to that, Then when you add the fact that we buy at $50,000 below market, you've already got $50,000 worth of equity.You've got your tenant paying your mortgage down.And now you're gaining equity at 5% just through pure appreciation.You've done nothing.I'm going to change the word appreciation to inflation.The value of your asset went up.And so in no time at all, The amount that you have in there equity-wise is 100, 200, 300% from what you put into the deal.You can't do that in other investments.It just doesn't happen.So when you look at this and you think about this in a long-term basis, you, as an American, as an X or Z or a Y generation person, whatever you are, you're going to grow old eventually. And eventually you're not going to be able to get up and go to work.I mean, look at Biden.Biden's an extreme example.But let's just consider Father Time's going to win this battle.Do you understand that?That's the reality.Somebody's going to lose.It's not going to be Father Time.It's going to be you. The older you get, the tireder you are, the less motivated you are to go in there and push the rock up the hill to get on the gerbil cage and run around the gerbil cave and less excited about getting in your car and driving 30 minutes to an hour to work and 30 minutes to an hour back, living a life of quiet desperation.The older you get, the more desperate that life becomes.But if you think about it, not only can you replace all that with this cash flow that we talked about, But over a period of time, your net worth is going up in value.You are becoming wealthier.Now let's turn around and look at the people that don't have real estate.Their net worth is going nowhere.In fact, because of inflation, their net asset value is going down in life.They're literally becoming poorer because everything else is becoming worth less.That's what inflation is doing to you. That's why the Democrats are having such a tough time explaining to people why they should love inflation.They don't.Because everything you own becomes worth less.The cost to buy the things you need goes up.That's inflation.But wait.If you own millions of dollars of real estate, that means you're making some percentage of inflation on that million.And so all of a sudden, inflation becomes your friend. Now, that's a bizarre animal right there.So you say, well, why are you not a Republican or a Democrat?Because the Democrats screw it up and there's mass inflation.My asset value goes up.So, wow.If the Democrats screw it up and make it to where there's no housing because nobody will build anything, then my asset value goes up. You understand?They do ridiculous things to try to destroy personal businesses.But people still need housing.Wow.On the other hand, the Republicans get in there and they make money cheap, then I can do more business.Then I can buy even more real estate, make even more money.Right?And if business is going well, then my cash flow will go up. People will have more money to pay.I can increase my rents.And business will be better.Now, heads I win, tails you lose is the life I want to live.Do you understand that?Heads I win, tails you lose.Inflation you lose.I don't.I make money.Heads I win.Republicans take over.Everything's great.Business is good again.I make more money. Tails.Democrats win.They screw up the economy.Inflation goes through the ceiling.They keep spending money they don't have to spend.And boom, my asset values go up.Now, you don't have that benefit if you don't own real estate.So every year since I was 34 years old, I retired at 34 years of age.I retired on houses, actually.Every year since I've retired, I've bought more real estate every year. already bought one this year I've got two more I'm buying they're already under contract and be closing pretty soon and I keep buying more real estate more and more and more and more and more people wonder how did you get so much money I'm been buying real estate since I was 34 years old think about that every year for 30 years I've been buying real estate And I'll keep buying it.Tell them 90.Tell them 100.Because I have all this cash.I have all this money coming in from all this real estate.You know, buy presents for our family.We go on trips.We do all the wonderful things you want to do.We take care of your church if you've got a church you belong to.But there's still tons of money left.So what do you do with that money?You buy more.And when you buy more, you make more money.Wow.It's an amazing thing. But that is a spiral you'll never get to if you don't own real estate.You're on the outside of the economy.You're one of the people that are just coexisting with life.You're just living a life of quiet desperation. everybody's got you in that box and Unless you are taught how to be an entrepreneur taught how to buy something and own some of the assets in this world All the benefits to come with owning assets equity capture cash flow appreciation Principal reduction and yes, we haven't got to it yet tax benefits You don't get to participate in You're an outsider Not in the game.Get up.Go to work.Earn money.Pay taxes.Go home.Go to bed.Get up.Go to work.Earn money.Pay taxes.Go home.Go to bed.Take a short break from that.We'll be right back with the Dumb Wombs Radio Show.

Welcome back to Del Wamsley Radio Show.Today we've been covering the five ways real estate makes you money and why that gives us a larger advantage over most investors.And why if you don't have real estate in your portfolio, you probably don't have the opportunity to retire at a very high level.You also probably never become a multimillionaire. A very high percentage of millionaires, and by the way, I've heard everybody say everything from 70%, 80%, 90% of all millionaires were real estate investors.I've heard it said that 80%, 90% of millionaires own real estate investments.That's probably more true. I mean, there's lots of ways to make money if you own your own companies and do things, right?But once you own your own company, you get tired of working every day, grinding and pushing the rock up the hill.If you ever want to retire without pushing the rock anymore, then I think 90% of the people probably did buy real estate to reinforce their business or to fulfill the income needs after they were ready to get out and or retire from their business. Having said that, you know, we're going to cover that.I want to cover one thing right now.For those of you who just tuned in, it's that time of year where we're out doing road trips again. I'm happy to say that it's exciting to me because there are a lot of good deals out there again.Whereas over the last two years from 2021, 2022, and then in the beginning of 2023, the prices had gotten so high and they didn't start coming down until 23 when they killed everything with the the rate increase interest rate increase but now that they have they brought the market back down to normal now real estate transactions work the way they're supposed to work again and so that's got me excited so I'm out there I'm traveling the country now doing road trips with people because I believe you need to go see these real estate deals.You need to see them, feel them, smell them to understand them.You need to be able to understand the difference between A class, B class, C class, and D class properties.If you can't, if you don't understand that, then you're not going to be able to pay the right price.I've been seeing people for the last three years pay way too much for real estate because they don't know.They're buying class properties. class B's C's and D's for Class A prices it's just ridiculous it really is it's scary and right now a lot of those people are paying the price for those bad decisions and we're out there buying that stuff from them 50 cents on the dollar because they made bad decisions bad decisions that I didn't make bad decisions that I didn't teach anybody to make bad decisions that I didn't mentor anybody to make right so those decisions have been made that's water under the bridge now what do you do with it well now you get out there and you buy this stuff 50 cents on the dollar from these people and i think really what they're saying is the market is adjusted down about 40 so it's not really 50 although you might find one where somebody's in worse situations they have to go down even more but let's just say the market's down about 40 that is beneficial for us the people buying right now So there's two places you can get on one of these road trips.One, if you're a member or going to become a member in San Antonio, I'm going to be there first week in August doing a road trip in San Antonio.We're going to apartment complexes.And then for those of you who are not members, the largest real estate expo in the world is I mean, there's no place where more real estate investors come than our expo.It's in Dallas, Texas.Actually, it's in Irving, Texas at the convention center there. And this is in October, the first week in October.And on that road trip, it's actually two days long.There's actually eight properties.And you can sign up either to ride in my bus or you can sign up to ride in one of the other eight buses.It's a little less if you don't ride with me.But if you ride personally with me, it's a little bit more because I will be telling stories the whole time.Now, wherever we stop and get out, I will be talking to people, pointing out what's important.So will my mentors be there. to point this out when we're done we'll come back and we'll have a debrief we'll go over every property what you should have seen you will learn more from this experience than you could taking a hundred classes because everything you talk about in class doesn't register till you see it when you see it it makes all the difference in the world so you want to get signed up for those two things the bus trip on the expo by the way, has limits.The San Antonio doesn't because we go in cars, but the bus trips has a limited number of seats.So I know there's still some seats left.You want to get in there and get registered right away because there's not a lot of seats left.I don't know how many, but you want to get in because every year it sells out.I mean, this isn't until October, and we're probably 90% sold out already.So... You want to get in there.I'm just telling you, not because I'm trying to pressure you, but because you don't want to be that last minute going, yeah, I should have gone.I'll go sign up and boom, they're gone because that happens.All right.So let's go back and get with the last way real estate makes you money.And that is tax advantages.Can you imagine if you go open a small business, you're going to pay for every dollar you earn out of the blocks, 15.3% Social Security and Medicare. Now, this is a brutal tax, and the reason it's brutal is because they're taking the money right now and giving it to illegal aliens to live, to give them free health care.All this money you thought you were piling up in a pile for Social Security and Medicare for you to retire someday for Americans is now being used to pay for illegal aliens, but it gets wasted other ways also. The bottom line is you have to pay it if you own your own business, 15.3%.Now, if you work for someone, you only have to pay half of it, and the employer has to pay half of it.So you're paying 7.3% or 7.4%, whatever it is, 7.5%, I don't even know.But it's half of that.So that's a big tax right there.Now let's go to federal income tax.Federal income tax goes anywhere from 15% to 42%. and you're paying that whatever it is don't i don't know how much you make but you're in there somewhere so you're paying 15 to 42 percent now if you own your own business that's 15 and 15 is 30 if it's 42 and 15 that's 57 ungodly then if you live in california new york illinois You have to pay state tax, income tax.And I just read an article this morning that said Californians just upped their state income tax to 14%.My friends, if you can avoid paying this 50% or 60% overall income tax rate, you can retire at 34 years of age.Hope you understand.And understand it's not the money, it's the lifestyle.Have a great day.We'll see you tomorrow.

That's what the Wall Street Journal is asking.There is hope.Google, for example, is rapidly expanding a one-year-old product called Green Light that will create green waves.That is one green light after another in 14 cities where the system is already deployed, says Juliet Rothenberg, product lead of Climate AI, part of Google Research. And research from the University of Michigan suggests these kinds of systems could actually save traffic agencies money, making it a no-brainer to adopt them.The secret sauce is that none of these solutions requires new hardware.Instead, they use data gathered directly from new... internet-connected vehicles or from navigation apps on their drivers' phones to help municipalities adjust the timing of their traffic lights, making them more responsive to real-world traffic patterns.Quote, instead of installing cameras at an intersection, if we know the trajectory of the vehicle, then the vehicle itself becomes the traffic sensor, says Henry Liu, who leads a research team at the University of Michigan. If this approach could be rolled out nationwide, as proponents say, it could make a significant dent in the amount of time we all spend idling at the country's 300,000-plus traffic signals.Data from the cities where Google's green light is already in operation, including Abu Dhabi, Hamburg, Seattle, and Kolkata suggest the system yields a 30% reduction in stop-and-go traffic at intersections.A 2021 study by traffic analytics company Inrix found that on short trips, Americans spend an average of 10% of their travel time stopped at lights.Reducing that time could help the climate and save our lungs, it says, since research indicates that pollution at intersections is 29 times higher than on open roads. and account for a lot of that idling.You know, these roundabouts, that's what Scottsdale's put in.Yeah, it makes things go nice and smooth.Google uses its own data gathered from users of Google Maps to optimize traffic light timing. Separately, researchers at the University of Michigan used telemetry data from connected General Motors vehicles to help the Detroit suburb of Birmingham, Michigan, evaluate the timing of 34 traffic signals back in 2022.The resulting changes the city made to the timing of those signals weren't huge, but they had a big effect on traffic flow during rush hour and other important times. That according to Danielle Deneau, director of traffic safety for Oakland County.One benefit of this system is that it cuts out the need for the expensive and time-consuming studies normally required to change the timing of a traffic signal, says Liu.Such studies involve counting the number of cars at a given intersection throughout a day and usually cost around $5,000 every time they are conducted. the cost of such studies is one reason the timing of traffic signals at most intersections is only updated once every five years and there are some intersections where timing hasn't been updated in decades yet at least half the traffic signals we encounter in our daily lives function much as they did 30 or more years ago.They are fixed time signals as opposed to the newer dynamic kind which use either cameras or sensors under the road surface to detect how many cars are present and adjust their timing accordingly.Today's traffic signals generally have one pattern for peak time such as rush hour on weekdays and another for off-peak like late at night or on the weekend says Deneau.In a perfect world every traffic signal would be dynamic and connected to a central control system so that an entire city or county could be optimized from moment to moment in much the way that traffic on the internet is constantly optimized to make our connections as fast as possible.But that's unrealistic because dynamic connected traffic signals can cost tens of thousands of dollars which turns into millions which in the government of course turns into billions and then trillions a complete modernization of an entire intersection can run upward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars says dineau and then there are the additional maintenance costs that come with running these more complicated systems which can add $5,000 a year to their operation.At those prices, cash-strapped regional agencies are limited to using what they already have, old-school fixed traffic signals.But they can update the timing on those old lights more frequently to improve overall traffic flow.When cities sign up for Greenlight, they get a dashboard that gives them recommendations for updating the timing of specific intersections. Importantly, Google's AI-powered system evaluates how traffic patterns change after signal timing is updated to allow cities to measure the real-world results of their changes.In Seattle, Greenlight Data convinced transportation planners to update the timing of lights at five intersections beginning in June of 2022, says a spokesman for the city's transportation department. After subsequent analysis, planners kept those updates at four of the intersections.The city is continuing to use the system alongside traditional methods, and planners believe it has the potential to save money in the future, he adds. Google's green light currently has a waiting list, but the project is rapidly expanding to new cities, which Google will announce later this year, says Rothenberg.But Lew says any tech startup or transit agency could do what his team did, since they made their methodology available to the public and anyone is free to use it. All that's required is getting the right kind of real-time data from auto manufacturers or navigation app makers.Quote, all the mathematics was there before we started, says Lou.The beauty of our approach is that the previous models were too complicated.All we did was simplify them. And simplifying your financial plan for retirement is the smartest thing you can do.Einstein said the surest sign of intelligence is simplification.And we can sure help you do that with sophisticated financial tools.At IQ Wealth, we help you manage your money so you can pursue your goals. with investments that make sense and income that never quits.Let's build your retirement strategy to take a lick and keep on ticking.Coming up next, we continue to examine the tools and strategies to help make your retirement the best it can be with smarter investments, more thoughtful planning, and fixed income in greater amounts.Then Shelly Grandage joins us.

Hey, Steve Jurich here.It's only natural.Most investors try to accumulate as much money as they can to alleviate the worry of running out of it one day.And why not?The more assets you have, the less you worry, right?If only that were true.Numerous studies show the more you make, the more you worry about losing it.That's why what really matters in retirement is reliable, steady cash flow that keeps you from draining your savings prematurely. Every dollar you get from Social Security, a pension, or annuity is a dollar that you do not have to take from an investment account.It can help you grow more money in the long run.This is how a carefully selected next-generation annuity can be instrumental in growing your wealth.That's right.By using fewer dollars to get more income from your secure annuity, you have more money to invest for growth.It's simple math and irrefutable logic.

Welcome back to the Common Sense Financial Hour, where financial success is not only possible, but highly attainable.I'm Steve Jurich.It's time now for the Mastering Money Market Intel segment.Flyers, especially those traveling to Europe, can't get enough of the upper middle class. Section of the airplane, says the Wall Street Journal.Premium economy seats are one notch below business class, one above the biggest parts of the coach.Not quite business class and definitely not coach.Premium economy cabins are hooking travelers willing to treat themselves to extra comfort for about double the price of a coach seat on some flights. With offerings labeled Premium Plus, Premium Select, or Premium Economy, or Delta Comfort, airlines are expanding these sections, which typically come with roomy seats, early boarding, free alcohol, and better meals.Airlines say they appeal to travelers with more disposable income, especially on long-haul flights where business-class seats can run thousands of dollars more.Yeah. I refer to it as an upper-middle cabin for the upper-middle class, says Jay Sorensen, an industry consultant and president of IdeaWorks Company.These sections appeal to travelers on work trips with budget-conscious employers and vacationers who want some comforts without shelling out for business class.Unlike with Delta Airlines Comfort Plus or other sections with extra legroom, Major U.S.carriers don't give their loyalty members complimentary upgrades into these cabins on transatlantic routes.Travelers upgrade with cash or miles, use upgrade certificates, or just simply buy the tickets outright.For flights to Europe from the U.S., round-trip tickets in the premium economy cabin average about double the cost of main cabin tickets, according to a fair analysis conducted by IdeaWorks.Business class seats on those routes are roughly double the cost of premium economy seats.So we're actually talking about, it's still a major price, don't get me wrong, but it is a far less cost than the business class.Premium economy cabins are part of airlines' broader push Toward deluxe offerings, they also play into carriers' loyalty strategies.Higher-tiered members get special upgrade points or certificates they can apply toward the seats.Travelers who do the math on upgrades say the decision depends on the costs, which can vary depending on demand and time of purchase. Customers also factor in flight length, whom they are traveling with, and how much legroom they need.One 68-year-old retiree from the Houston area takes three to four international trips a year with his wife.They recently flew in United Airlines Premium Plus seats to Europe.Jameson says his wife managed to sleep. in premium plus which he typically can't do in coach because upgrades are now harder to come by and depend on status jameson says he pays for the seats on overnight transatlantic flights once you've had a taste of it there's typically no going back he says u.s based airlines are equipping more planes with premium cabins to compete with international carriers long-standing Premium Economy Service, according to analysts, American Airlines introduced long-haul premium economy seating back in 2016, the first domestic carrier to do so. It plans to increase the number across its fleet in the coming years, says Kimberly Sysak, the company's vice president of customer experience.Andrew Nosellich, United's chief commercial officer, said in the airline's recent call that earnings would be increasing as a result of all these premium seat sales.The Premium Plus cabin averages 21 seats on long-haul international flights. but it has now become the carrier's most profitable section.German carrier Lufthansa, which introduced premium economy nearly a decade ago, now has 52 premium economy seats on its Airbus A380-800 wide-body airliners. Qantas Airways plans to add 40-seat premium economy cabins, 40, man, to its A350s.That's arriving in 2026.The planes will fly direct to New York from Australia's East Coast.One 32-year-old interviewed by the Journal who works for the state of Florida is a self-described normal Joe Schmoe who spends cautiously. She used a formula of dividing the price for the seat by the number of hours of the flight to decide if she would upgrade to treat herself for her birthday.After consulting forums on Reddit, she learned that $50 an hour is considered a standard rate to justify an upgrade. An upgrade from economy to premium select cost $800 in the days before her flight.But when she checked in at the airport, she saw an upgrade offer for $375, roughly $29 an hour of flying.I didn't even think twice, she said.I just said to myself, sold.The flight attendant served her food with dishware, but it seemed to be the same food as the main cabin.She received noise-canceling headphones, a blanket, and a pillow. As a bonus, the seat beside her was empty.She rates the service as an 8 out of 10, somewhat less than the treatment she expected for the extra money spent.A Delta spokesman says about 70% of customers who book premium seats with the airline repurchase them on future flights.Delta plans to increase the number of premium select cabins on future routes. United's Premium Plus seats are similar to domestic first-class seats in terms of seat size and pitch.According to one United executive, the distance between seats, that's known as pitch, of Premium Plus is between 38 and 40 inches compared with 31 inches in the main cabin on wide-body plates. One of the most popular markets for those seats is on routes to and from London's Heathrow Airport.Some travelers complain that airlines have no incentive to improve the main cabin experience as long as they continue to introduce new classes of better seats. Probably true.Premium economy is simply not as nice as laying down flat in business class.It does beat coach.But if you're going in the afternoon rather than a red-eye, I've found it's not too bad.Well, eventually the world beats a path to the door of common sense and the fundamentals.Why not get there first?I think the world will be coming back to the basics soon.All the craziness has got to lead to a crash, not necessarily a financial crash, just a crash in people's thinking, you know, might start going to church again, things like that.So, hey, why not get there first?We can help.We can help manage your money so you can pursue your life goals with investments that make sense and income that never quits.

And today, let's move away from the world of economics and markets to the very important topic of making sure you have the best health insurance you can find at a very reasonable price, working with a caring professional who puts you first.You want not only a low price, we all do. But we also want something that's going to work as we hope it will.And we need a dependable plan.Then we need to work with someone who can help us find that.Someone we can trust without any sales pressure to help us sort out all of the TV ads and misinformation floating around.But that person has to be extremely knowledgeable.You don't want to just go to the first salesperson you find. who already knows what they want to put you into before they meet you.That's not how it goes.You need someone who has it all at her disposal and can help you sort it out, as I said, and work from there and find what is really best for you.And that's why we like to talk with Shelly Grandin.She's one of the top agents in the nation.She's been doing it for more than 20 years.She is skilled in all areas of health insurance, and that would be both individual and small business plans. She's an authority on Medicare.Shelly runs a complete concierge health insurance, dental and Medicare agency.And although she is recognized nationally, Shelly is focused on taking care of clients who want an experienced guide to help with the confusing maze of health and Medicare insurance products.Shelly Grandage, welcome back to Mastering Money. Good morning, Steve.Good morning, Shelley.Well, Shelley, we want to talk today.There's an area of insurance, and one of the things we were discussing before going on the air, so let's clear that up quickly.There are governmental programs when it comes to health insurance. We're not a fully socialistic society.I mean, some things have.We're moving toward socialism.And, you know, there's people who just, you know, can't afford anything else.And so society has to take care of them.I think when socialistic programs get abused, that's a problem.But there are governmentally sponsored programs. And then there's those from the private sector.You know, people have mentioned, does Shelly mean private like three guys and a girl in an office?No, no.You're talking about multi-billion dollar insurance companies.When you say private, don't you just mean private sector, not government sponsored?Exactly.So to be clear, when we're talking about under 65 health insurance, I just had a comment today that kind of blew me away, which is what you and I were talking about.Right. They're really only if you don't have employer-sponsored.If you're working for a big company, you probably have a pretty decent option.But if that's not you, you're 1099, you're not working, you're whatever, you're a stay-at-home mom, you've got babies, we have the Marketplace, which is bound by the Affordable Care Act, and that's a law.And that law requires all of those companies that contract with the Marketplace to This is government-regulated to adhere to certain guidelines.So free preventative care, you have to cover maternity, you have to cover mental health.Now, because it's government-sponsored, right, so the Cigna's, the UnitedHealthcare's, all those big names that you used to hear, now they're all government-sponsored, okay, affiliated with the marketplace.The government's been pumping money, subsidy money, into the marketplace to to make health insurance more affordable for lower-income people.Right, right, right.Now, so those rates are all on a sliding scale.So if you're a lower-income person, you have several children, that's probably the most affordable place to go, right?Uh-huh, right.Now, if you're like you or me, we're, you know, more fortunate, we're a little bit probably higher earners, we're not going to get any subsidy, and we're going to pay for a very expensive HMO.Right, right. So on the flip side, I do a lot of private insurance.And, again, here's the comment that blew me away, and I want to clarify for our listeners.Right, right.My person said, well, you mean private is for-profit health insurance?I don't want that.Let me be clear.All businesses are for-profit.If they're not making you profit – then they're out of business.You think goodwill doesn't make money?You know, the goodwill where you drop stuff off?Exactly.They make a lot of money, right?They do.So anyway, all private insurance means, again, big companies, is that they don't have to adhere to those Affordable Care Act guidelines, you know, where you can't ask any health questions.And they have the right... to ask you health questions.Now, the benefit of those plans, though, is they're nationwide PPO plans.There's a lot of flexibility.And in general, your rates can be lower because they are asking you health questions.They're not having to take the cancer patients, right? So that when I talk to our listeners about private health insurance, that's what I mean.Yeah, because think about it.You're paying a monthly premium for health insurance of $500, but you already had cancer and you knew it. and all of a sudden they have a bill of 200 000 to cover for you for your 500 bucks a month no business can run like that that's why they they need to screen for that and if you have a cancer or something that's a tough well that's what the affordable care act now takes care of as i said there's a resistance to socialistic medicine but people can't afford it you can't let people you know die on the street so It's a different topic for a different day.But the fact is you're just simply talking.There are government-sponsored programs where there are really no health questions, right?I mean, on an Affordable Care Act policy, what are the types of health questions one might see?Are there any?There are none.So that's part of the act.It's illegal to ask any health questions of the person. So again, just as you said, I mean, you know, it's not your fault that you were born a type 1 diabetic.It's not your fault that you get cancer.So that's, you know, the plan is there for that.And for, you know, for women that are having babies, that's the right place to be because those plans have to include maternity, right? So it's not like an all good or an all bad thing either way.It's just a different system.Yeah, good point.That's a great way to put it.Thank you.Hey, let's talk about small business for a second.I mean, a lot of people out there, like you said, work for large companies and have gold-plated health insurance that even their spouse can be on.But what about small businesses? you know, 7, 9, 11 employees, plumbing contractors, home builders, whatever, they want to put a plan out there to retain employees, take care of them, put smiles on their faces.What's available?Do you work with small business plans?Yeah, absolutely.Love doing those because I've been a small business owner myself for over 20 years.Mm-hmm. And easy rule of thumb is the smaller you are, the more expensive that traditional health insurance is going to be.And there are so many small employers out there, Steve, that will tell me, Shelly, I can't afford it.I want to offer health insurance to my employees, but I can't afford it.Yeah. Well, the good news is, is that if you work with somebody like me, because I think of myself as a problem solver, right?Exactly.We can do some of that non-traditional.We can do more private plans where we can ask the health questions.And if you have a younger group, you know, your rates can be half.I'm going to give you just a really recent example.I have a construction company, okay?Now, they've been with me for a long time, so they've had the the non-traditional where I get to ask health questions, and now they have the traditional.But their traditional plan, it's a Cigna plan, Steve, has gotten so expensive that they have a 20-something-year-old new employee that they wanted me to quote him and his child.It was $1,200 a month for that employee. to add for himself and his child on the Cigna plan.Whereas I could have given him the Every Bill and Whistle private health insurance plan because he's a young guy, right, with his child for probably $400 a month.From a very large private sector company, not private insurance, not Shelley's backroom insurance.Yeah, you're just talking about not government.Yeah, right. Exactly, not government-sponsored.And, you know, people are funny.We all have our opinions.Sometimes I pick up the phone to a new caller, and they're like, I want nothing to do with the government, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.And so then I go, okay, well, I have to ask you the health questions, right, to see if you're going to qualify for this other type of program.They're in shock when you have to ask the health questions, right? Yeah, they're in shock when you have to ask health questions, and they don't want anything to do with the government program.Exactly.So you can't have it always.There's no perfect system.There is not.Well, that's what your job is.You listen.You find out what the person is really seeking.You help them with their misconceptions in a very polite way.I mean, that's the thing is... People have conceptions.They have misconceptions.They've received misinformation.They watch TV commercials, and you can get plenty of that.But give us an example of what type of savings you've helped small businesses with over the past year. My second one is the Whitewater Rafting Company.I insure out of West Virginia, and the owner lives in Arizona.So he might be listening because I think that's where he contacted me a few years ago.But, you know, we're talking like six employees.I save them 50% on the premium with a far better plan because, you know, when you're small like that, the only way you usually can offer insurance to your employees is to give them a really high deductible plan.Right. So nobody was happy because they had a big deductible to meet before the plan paid anything.I was able to offer them a plan with no deductible.So you can go to the doctor right away.You can get your colonoscopy.You can get your blood work done, just the day-to-day things that make people feel better about having health insurance.Put that in dollar terms, 50%.What do you mean?I mean, what was he paying, and what did he end up paying? So we're talking probably $6,000 a month, about $1,000 per employee for a high deductible plan to $3,000 a month. for a plan with no deductible.And they're happy.Everybody's happy.The employer's happy.He saved 50% and the employees are happy because they can go to the doctor.Yeah, because you don't want your employees muttering about, you know, they're 28 years old and they say, I don't even feel like I have insurance.I have to pay for anything anyway.So, yeah.Well, hey, I'll tell people they can get a hold of you, Shelly, and I think they should.So thanks for stopping in.We've run out of time today, but we'll be back soon.

Guarantees rely on the financial strength of the insurer, so compare with leading annuity authority Steve Jurich now.Visit IQannuity.com.IQannuity.com.IQannuity.com.One of the most common questions people ask is if they can still afford to retire on a million or two million dollars anymore. With stocks near all-time highs and bonds at all-time lows, it's actually a great question.2008 taught millions of retiring engineers, teachers, and other professionals a costly lesson, that years of market gains can be wiped out in just weeks of market losses.

As you weigh the potential benefits of well-meaning advice from non-professionals or you review commonly cited investment rules, consider that most are designed for that average situation, which means they may be wrong as often as they're right. That's actually the definition of average.Two rules, though, are very helpful when planning for retirement, the Rule of 100 and the Rule of 72.The Rule of 100 is all about allocation, risk tolerance, and time horizon.How much of your money should be kept safe and how much at risk, do you know?Well, the Rule of 100 is a good starting point.Take your age, subtract it from the number 100.The remaining number is the maximum percent that a conservative or moderate investor should should keep at risk in the market.If you're aggressive, a little bit more.It's not set in stone, but it will help you grow your nest egg over time and keep things much better organized.And the fact is, you need to have a good portion of your money safe these days, out of harm's way, and producing spendable income throughout your retirement.The rule of 72 is different.It's an infallible rule of mathematics. Take the rate of return you're getting on an investment.Divide that rate into the number 72.The result is how long it will take to double your money at that rate of return.If you're making 8%, your money will double in nine years.That's how annuity income riders work.They may grow your income capital on a guaranteed basis at 8% guaranteed, even if the market is falling by 50%.Your income is safe, secure, and pays you for a lifetime guaranteed. With the IQL Smarter Bucketing System, you will have both rules working for you at one time in a clear written financial plan.You will have a strategy for growing your nest egg systematically over the long run in one bucket while being paid a secure, reliable income for life up from 5% to 12% or more depending on age and deferral period in a clear written financial plan. 480-902-3333.480-902-3333.And visit IQWealth.com.IQWealth.com.Hey, thanks for tuning in.Hope you enjoyed sharing some time with us today.We sure enjoyed being with you, that's for sure.Take care now.See you next time.Make it a great day.

Fitz, Jimmy Fitz, a.k.a.Crypto Fitz.Thank you so much for joining us.Our new show, noon to two every Wednesday here on Money Radio.A big week.So much to convey.The big Bitcoin conference, Nashville 2024. It was last weekend, and what a happening it was.James, did you hear anything about it, or did you watch any of that?I didn't watch anything.I heard a couple little glips in the news about the things that Trump said and that RFK Jr.said and how they're embracing Bitcoin.They want to embrace Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency.So I heard a few things, but I wasn't deeply invested like you are. Well, I dug in deep, James.It was fascinating.Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle converging on Nashville.This is the first time that they've had this conference in Nashville put on by Bitcoin Magazine, who headquarters in Nashville.The last three years prior, it was in Miami.And they had crowds of like 20,000 every year. This year, making the switch to Nashville, they actually exceeded that number.And as you mentioned, Donald Trump, RFK Jr., Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis introducing a very important bill that we're going to talk about.We're going to try to do a wrap-up and play a little bit of President Trump's keynote address along with RFK Jr.And of course, we couldn't Play segments from the Bitcoin conference without one of the keynote speakers, Michael Saylor.He's earning the name the godfather of crypto.He's mentioned as much as Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. So this show today is going to be all about the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, where we're at with Bitcoin, where we're at with this new legislation that's being introduced.And we'll play some of the addresses, which were fascinating, like you were just referring to, James.The excitement down there was palpable.And witnessing this, even virtually, I was supposed to be there in person. But with the timing of launching our new show in Phoenix here on Money Radio, I needed to dig in and pay attention to our launch.So I was able to probably cover more ground watching it virtually.You know, like they say, the best seats are in your house.Yep, exactly.It's like watching the Olympics.Okay, look at the view we get of all those amazing athletes from our couch.Yeah. I think, you know, we were talking about all the great speakers they had and the buzz that was going on in Nashville.I think the thing I guess I'm trying to say is you finally have political officials who are coming out and, you know, a guy, a former president who wants to be president again that's embracing the cryptocurrency culture. And saying, hey, we need to be the staple.This country needs to be the staple for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and regulate it so people aren't afraid to invest in it.And I think that's what all the buzz is out.It's not that kind of, for lack of a better term, unique or weird investment.It's starting to become more mainstream.Exactly.And I think that's what... I think that's what all the excitement about is you've got people, you know, not fringe people, but like, you know, Donald Trump made a lot of money in real estate and he's embracing cryptocurrencies.Well, he's also made a lot of money in the blockchain space already with his NFTs that he's been launching the last few years ago.He actually... launched an nft collection when he was president for uh the first lady melania trump that sold very well they did it with solana on their blockchain and a lot of uh you know the mass media didn't cover it because they don't really know about it but he has been and remember he's got very intelligent sons that have been educating him as well yeah you know exactly All their friends are in it.Their buddies are into it.They're investing in it.All these companies who, I mean, the amount of sponsor representation in Nashville for this Bitcoin conference, James, was really amazing.Enlightening, exciting, inspirational.I can't say enough about it. took me like a day just to come down from the enthusiasm and also just trying to keep up on all the information coming out because part of what we do here on the Crypto Fit Show is we try to keep up with all media to give you the good, the bad, and the ugly on the space, the crypto ecosystem, what's going on on Capitol Hill, what's going on on Wall Street.And as you mentioned, You know, the end of the year, last year, all the talk was, are these spot Bitcoin ETFs going to be approved?And is Wall Street going to push it forward?Well, all that lobbying effort and everything came to a head January 10, when the spot Bitcoin ETFs got approved, right?Right.It hit market.It was the biggest inflow of any ETF offering in Wall Street history. That tells you a lot.And we've got numbers to back that up, but I'm not going to dig into those weeds right now.We've got a lot of other stuff to talk about and dig in on, especially with this Bitcoin conference.We are going to bring you up to date on the Ethereum. ETF that launched last week.Very impressive inflows.The numbers are a little confusing for newbies, so we'll try to dig into that later on in the show.And I'm also excited in today's show, James, that I have Jed Powers, who is the head of the Reading Bitcoin Center, the only Bitcoin center in the state of California.And he has such a depth of knowledge and an interesting path Because all of us Bitcoiners, we all have different ways we got into the space.James, do you remember the first time you heard the word Bitcoin and asked what the heck it was?I heard it.I was hosting a radio show. And the host brought up Bitcoin here at the station.And I didn't know what it was.It was some invisible currency that you had to mine.And there was only so much of it.And it just kind of seemed like a fairy tale at the time.And now you have a former president of the United States that's embracing Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies.It's come so far.You know, these Bitcoin ETFs were launched on January 11th. And the biggest asset managers in the world, BlackRock, Fidelity, go down the list.They're all in it.They all launched their Ethereum spot ETFs.So the crypto space and, you know, once again, we talk about crypto and Bitcoin.We're really going to focus on Bitcoin today because of this conference and try to stress the importance of it.Part of what we're going to do with this show is I really have to walk a line for introducing people to the space, telling them what this is about, stressing the importance, giving them tools to do their own research and point them in different directions.So that's what we're going to do every Wednesday noon to two right here on Money Radio.Jimmy Fitz, a.k.a.Crypto Fitz.We'll be back with Michael Saylor from Bitcoin 2024.

Bitcoin at $66,505, a little bit over 1% up.Ethereum at $3,315 on the heels of the Ethereum ETF launch.All kinds of tools, late-breaking, up-to-the-minute crypto news on the website, CryptoFits.io.That's CryptoFits.io.You hear MicroStrategy talked about a lot.Michael Saylor, because he's such a big flag waver, MicroStrategy, the company that went on the Bitcoin standard a few years ago, their stock price is between like $1,600 and $1,700.And the stock is going to split on August 24.MicroStrategy doing a 10 to 1 split.It's a business software company, but they hold more Bitcoin on their balance sheet than any other corporation or nation state. Let that sink in for a minute.And we're talking billions of dollars.Now, they're trying to make MicroStrategy a little bit more accessible to the retail environment because of this 10 to 1 stock split.So do the math.A lot of people are going to be able to buy shares of MicroStrategy now.It's a way for them to raise more money to buy more Bitcoin.And Michael Saylor goes out.He's interviewed 24-7.It seems like he's on every podcast ever. I haven't had a chance to be able to interview him.I can't wait.Natalie Brunel, who has interviewed him often, who's a bright light in this space and who I have a few podcasts on my website with.She's such a delight and a bright light and a Bitcoin maxi.She and I have kidded about Michael Saylor.You know, he talks so much and has this stream of consciousness about Bitcoin. He's the easiest interview in the world.You go, Michael, so tell us what the latest is on your thoughts on Bitcoin.And then about a half hour later, Michael, thank you so much.What a great interview.Really appreciate it.The easiest interview in the world, James.Those are the best, right?Yes, they are.All right.Let's hear Michael Saylor set up the convention in Nashville. from this past weekend at bitcoin 2024 micro strategies michael saylor i want to talk about the bitcoin revolution and i also want to talk about rebuilding our global economy with digital capital the world as we know it based on 20th century ideas and 20th century technology.Stocks trade 9.30 to 4 unless there's a bank holiday, you can't do things on the weekend, everything is slow, everything is expensive.If we want to prosper in the 21st century, we need new ideas and they need to be based on new technology. This chart you've seen before, I popped it up, it's 900 trillion dollars of global wealth.It's that 900 trillion, it's spread across physical assets and financial assets that are 20th century ideas, 20th century technology.And in the upper left corner is a little orange blip, the little orange asset that could, what we call Bitcoin, it's one trillion, It seems like a lot if you started with zero, but when you look at it against the greater scheme of things in the world, it's 0.1%.Here's another way to see that same chart.It's not 900 trillion of assets.It's a bunch of assets held for their utility value and a bunch of assets held as a store of value, long-term capital. When I buy a house, I want to live in it.But when I buy a bunch of bonds, I just put my money there because I didn't know what else to do with the money.And when you start to see the world as a big chunk of long-term capital, $450 trillion or more of capital, and you start to think about the way we store that capital, you see the engine for the revolution. The global economy struggles because we're relying upon imperfect assets and imperfect systems to store that capital.It's crippling our capital preservation.So how do we engineer a better system?Energy is money, or capital, or wealth.You could use them interchangeably for this speech. You can check out that speech in its entirety on YouTube.There are a lot of great videos from the Bitcoin Conference 2024 in Nashville and check them out.Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, if you're not hip to him, he's worth digging into if you're interested in the future of money and the digital economy, hard money, what Bitcoin is.That's what we're all about here on CryptoFits is spreading the word. You know, this is like learning six languages at one time and also trying to give information to those who are a little bit more sophisticated as well and maybe have been in this space for a while.And maybe you have a background or a story, good, bad or ugly, because all three are represented in the crypto space.You know, they're all over.We talked about it last week, James, about twenty eight thousand what they call cryptocurrencies. But there are very few that have the real right utility.There are a lot of projects being built on the Layer 1 Bitcoin blockchain to speed up transaction speed and be able to handle more transactions.The Lightning Network you might have heard of.Michael Saylor, a big proponent and his company working on that initiative today. But keep an eye on MicroStrategy.And once again, CryptoFits is not financial advice.I'm not a financial advisor.This is information for you to dig deep, do your own research if you're interested in the future of money, protecting your hard-earned assets for the future.We're about education.I'm not selling you anything.I'm not telling you to buy anything.I'm not telling you to get in this space. You need to educate yourself so you feel real comfortable getting in the pool and understanding the importance of this future of money and what's going on with the digital economy. And Michael Saylor, once again, he also has a Saylor University.He's all about spreading the education.So you can Google Michael Saylor, S-A-Y-L-O-R.His background is incredible.The guy is definitely a savant.And to say he's a believer and a Bitcoin proponent is quite an understatement. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., when the election process started and the candidates started coming forward and he put his hat in the ring, he was the first one to say that he would be friendly to the crypto community.And James, we've got, let's get that cut of RFK Jr., cut four up."

I am so glad to be back from my second Bitcoin conference. Since last year in Miami, I've been meeting with leaders and thinkers from this community.I've conferred with Bitcoin miners, with policymakers, with economists, with financial experts, with investors and developers and entrepreneurs that deepen my understanding of the extraordinary promise of Bitcoin for our country and for our planet.After After all I've learned, I intend, as President of the United States, to sign an executive order on day one, directing the Department of Justice and the US Marshals to transfer the approximately 200,000 Bitcoin held by the US government to the United States Treasury, where it will be held as a strategic asset. On day one as president, I will sign another executive order directing the U.S.Treasury to purchase 550 Bitcoin daily until the U.S.has built a reserve of at least 4 million Bitcoins. and a position of dominance that no other country will be able to usurp.Our nation holds approximately 19% of global gold reserves.This policy will give us about the same proportion of total Bitcoin.The cascading impact from these actions will eventually move Bitcoin to a valuation of hundreds of trillions of dollars. On day one as president, I will sign also an executive order directing the IRS to issue public guidelines that all transactions between Bitcoin and the U.S.dollar are unreportable transactions. And by extension, non-taxable.How to be a popular guy.You don't have to pay taxes on your gains.Now, to every Bitcoiner, that's music to their ears, James.Yeah, mine.I mean, I don't want to pay taxes.Well, this has been the big complaint because those who invest in Bitcoin... Unless you're doing it and buying an ETF, unless you're doing it in a 401k or whatever, you're out there swimming in the pool and buying your Bitcoin with after-tax dollars, right?So you already paid tax on the money you earned so you could buy some Bitcoin and stack it.Well, then when you sell it at a profit, you got to pay capital gains on it. So this is what RFK Jr.is talking about.We'll dig in more with it.We're going to hear from President Donald Trump and his address, the keynote address from the Bitcoin Conference Nashville in 2024.It's moving to Vegas next week.We'll talk about that as well.

Say in your mind, what is the ideal financial plan?One that's high maintenance and totally dependent on a financial advisor or a secure low maintenance plan that can virtually complete itself and comes with a full time customer service staff.Few investments are maintenance free.For example, how long will your money last in a pile of risky mutual funds? Answer, not very long if we get another 2008 crash.If you start taking 5% a year from your investments and they get cut in half by a crash, you're suddenly taking 10% annually to get the same income.Not sustainable.At that point, you need a magician, not a financial advisor.Let's get together soon to build a plan for you that is simple, virtually maintenance-free, and comes with a lifetime guarantee.

We're talking about Bitcoin, the Bitcoin conference that wrapped up in Nashville with a lot of big names and a lot of big policymakers from Capitol Hill in attendance and talking to the audience, including Democrat Congressman Ro Khanna, who has been very vocal about trying to get his fellow Democrats on board, saying that America needs to be the innovators in cryptocurrency technology. We need to embrace Bitcoin before the rest of the world does.Otherwise, it'll be too late and we won't be able to catch up.Ro Khanna carrying the Bitcoin flag.He also recently held a crypto roundtable with Mark Cuban and other crypto industry leaders.He was speaking at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville this past weekend, and he discussed how Democrats are embracing crypto. and how some of the topics they covered, how the U.S.can be the leader in crypto, changing the perception that Democrats are anti-crypto, recent crypto roundtable takeaways, speaking to the Harris team about crypto, and if the current vice president becomes president, will Gary Gensler be removed as the SEC chair? He also did updates on the FIT 21 bill and talked about Bitcoin as a U.S.Treasury Reserve asset.So, James, both sides of the aisle sound like they're looking for a way and they're starting to figure out that if we carry Bitcoin as a reserve asset and if Bitcoin, when Bitcoin does what we expect it to do, It could have a great deal to do with helping with this. humongous debt that our country has amassed over 35 trillion well we need something to help us out with it that's for sure you're not kidding we're looking for that one little gleam of light in the gray sky with that stuff right we're looking for that lottery ticket because it's just the spending that this administration and previous administrations have done it's out of control and it's no doubt it's going to hurt your kids and your grandkids no doubt about it Senator Cynthia Lummis, senator from Wyoming, Republican senator, has been working across the aisle for the last several years with Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat from New York, on bipartisan legislation to give some good direction and get people, give companies who are building a clear-cut path on how they can operate and continue to grow this future of money in the United States. She, at the Bitcoin conference, along with Tim Scott, they shared the stage together, Florida Congressman Tim Scott.They proposed Bitcoin strategic reserve strategy to bolster the U.S.economy.At the conference, Cynthia Lummis introduced, quote, the Bitcoin strategic reserve bill aimed at establishing a strong Bitcoin reserve to mitigate the national debt and strengthen the economy, quote, The bill proposes converting federal assets into Bitcoin, capitalizing on its appreciating value without raising taxes.That's one that gets our ears up peaked as well.Right, James?Got my attention.No raising taxes.Thank you. The Bitcoin reserve bill will transform the U.S.economy, says Cynthia Lummis.And you can read more about and see her on YouTube as well.She is a lot of fun, very passionate, has spent a lot of time studying Bitcoin and the crypto space.And as I always say, James, you know, learning about Bitcoin and the future of money and the digital economy is like learning six languages at one time. But if you're patient with yourself and you do the work.Yeah, that's the important thing.You've got to do the work.You've got to do the work.Don't take what I tell you as gospel or anyone who acts like they know what they're talking about.It's like don't take a tip about a horse in a race from any schmo.So common sense will serve you well in this space. So she introduced this bill at the Bitcoin conference.It's been getting a lot of attention and talk.RFK Jr., who we heard a little while ago talking about Bitcoin and buying a big stack of that baby for the future of our country.And now let's go to the keynote speaker, President Donald Trump, over the weekend and listen to the response of the crowd in Nashville and listen to his opening remarks. I stand before you today filled with respect and admiration for what the Bitcoin community has achieved.It's incredible, actually.I sort of say to my sons, it's like incredible because they know so much about it.They're so aware of it, much more so than people that are a little bit older.But I say this is the steel industry of 100 years ago.It really is.I think you're just in your infancy.I can see it happening. In just 15 years, Bitcoin has gone from merely an idea posted anonymously on an internet message board to being the ninth most valuable asset anywhere in the world.Can you believe that?Is that right?That's a big deal. Think of that.It's already bigger than Exxon Mobil.Soon it will be surpassing the entire market cap of silver.It's not bad.How about gold?How about gold?Let's go gold. And one day it probably will overtake gold.But based on the way it's going now, it could very well be a possibility.There's never been anything like it.And I don't think you've ever seen anything like it.And most people have no idea what the hell it is.You know that, right?So what happens when they figure it out?That's going to really be something.Bitcoin is not just a marvel of technology.As you know, it's a miracle of cooperation and human achievement in a lot of relationships that are formed.I just did a meeting around table with a lot of the leaders and it's amazing.There's a great camaraderie.It's really interesting.There's obviously there's competition, but there's a relationship.There's a friendship that's developed with a lot of these people.I noticed that I don't usually see that too often. I see the opposite, actually.They want to get each other.They want to kill each other.These guys have a great feeling.Very smart people, too.Congratulations on all that you've accomplished.This room is amazing.The people in this room, high IQ individuals.Donald Trump addressing the overflowing crowd at the Bitcoin Conference 2024 that wrapped up this past weekend. in Music City, USA, Nashville, Tennessee.So entertaining and so much optimism and hope and people coming together, realizing the importance of figuring this all out.And when he said most people don't know what it is, I can attest to that.Most people in my travels ask me about it.They want to know about it.They have preconceptions of what they've heard.A lot of my friends who have... Really cutting edge, very smart children have educated the parents.You heard President Trump talk about his sons filling him in on the situation.And that's what's really leading the charge.The millennials and the Gen Zers get it.And they're all about the digital world, as you know.They know everything. nothing else.They didn't grow up in an analog world.Right, James?That's right.You know what struck me about this?I was thinking about this while I was listening to the clip.He was talking about, you know, it's like the infancy of the steel industry.Right.But also, I kind of thought, you know how many people say, Man, I should have bought Amazon when it was at $15 a share.I should have bought Coca-Cola back when, you know, in the 80s or the 70s.I mean, we're in that time right now with Bitcoin where, you know, it could be American Telephone and Telegraph, you know.No doubt.Go ahead. No, no doubt about it.So, you know, people make the analogy to the Internet of the 90s and the growth and the adoption back then.The big difference now is everybody's got a cell phone.Everyone's got a computer.Right.Back back then, not everyone had a computer.And that was a lot of people's entree into the financial system as well with. 401ks corporations onboarding people into wall street you know the the the all the tech you know you got mail dial up internet that whole learning curve this is that on warp speed well i guess we'll be back in just a minute huh crypto fits yes sir This is the Fox Business Report.The Federal Reserve is leaving rates unchanged, and it says there has been some progress on inflation towards its 2% goal.Here's Fed Chair Jerome Powell at his press conference on a possible September rate cut.The broad sense of the committee is that the economy is moving closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate.

Welcome back to Crypto Fitz.I'm Jimmy Fitz, a.k.a.Crypto Fitz.That's J-I-M-I.Follow me on X at Crypto Jimmy Fitz.J-I-M-I.Crypto Jimmy Fitz on X. and our website, cryptofits.io..io is like a .com, but it's .io.Great tools there for you.I have podcasts, a late-breaking, up-to-the-minute crypto news, a 24-7 ticker, because the market never closes in the crypto ecosystem. We also have a blog on the homepage, a link there, that takes you to explanations of what we talk about here on CryptoFits as we introduce you to our new show.It's all about education.It's all about spreading the word, sending you to different places, including my website, to do your own research.If you're interested in the future of money and you're concerned about how the dollar is losing its purchasing power, We know what's going on with inflation.We know what our grocery prices are.We know the gas pump prices.We know what's going on.We know what's happening to our middle class and how much of a struggle this time period is with... with these interest rates being what they've been.Now, they're saying we will get at least one reduction.I don't know how much that's going to do for anything, but they say before the end of the year, we're going to have one interest rate drop.So we'll see if that pans out or not.All about Bitcoin and wrapping up the Bitcoin conference in this edition of Crypto Fits. Nashville, Tennessee, it was so happening this past weekend, the excitement, the anticipation.And, you know, you've heard me, if you're a regular listener to CryptoFits, you've heard me report on Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, who has been regulating through punishment, pretty much, as opposed to these clear-cut guidelines that everyone's been asking for.Not necessarily a popular guy in the cryptosphere. And listen to what President Trump said in this segment here about Gary Gensler.Check this out and check the crowd response out.This afternoon, I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the Bitcoin superpower of the world.And we'll get it done. If crypto is going to define the future, I want to be mined, minted and made in the USA.It's going to be.It's not going to be made anywhere else.And if Bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say, it's going to the moon.I want America to be the nation that leads the way.And that's what's going to happen.No, you're going to be very happy with me.You're going to be so happy. He's the greatest guy.That's why I'm proud to be the first major party nominee in American history to accept donations in Bitcoin and crypto. And they've made a lot of them, I might tell you.And I appreciate it.Since we made that announcement on May 21st, we have already raised $25 million, much of it in Bitcoin, crypto and others, others that are very, very good also.I pledge to the Bitcoin community that the day I take the oath of office, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's anti-crypto crusade will be over.It will end.It'll be done.It'll be done. Day one, I will fire Gary Gensler and appoint a new SEC chairman.I didn't know he was that unpopular.Wow. I didn't know he was that unpopular.Let me say it again.On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler.Wow.Gary Gensler has a lot of fans, doesn't he?Wow.That was right there front and center, wasn't it, James?Yep. Well, you know, I like the fact that he said that they started taking donations in Bitcoin.And you heard the crowd reaction because, you know, the crowd, that's like music to their ears because, like we've talked about earlier, it's becoming more and more mainstream now that you've got a political candidate that says, hey, we'll take your Bitcoin just like we'll take your U.S.dollar. No doubt about it.We talked about RFK Jr.was the first one to come out of the political gate with taking crypto donations.And President Trump did not waste any time following up on the heels of that.But as we talked about before, he knows about crypto.He knows about blockchain.He knows about NFTs and all that good stuff.So it's just fascinating to... to watch the tide turn it wasn't too long ago james first of all that bitcoin it seems like i guess about a year and a half ago it was like 16 17 18 000 of bitcoin today it's 66 000 a bitcoin and as the supply dwindles The appetite for the asset continues because, remember, it's basic economics.Supply and demand.Cap supply of 21 million.You have these big asset management companies like the Black Rocks, the Fidelities, the Grayscales, the Arcs, the Wisdom Trees, Franklin Templeton.Go on down the line.They're all in it. and they have to hold Bitcoin as the underlying asset one-to-one, which means they're all... This is the first time this has really happened other than the gold ETFs.You know, with an ETF, an exchange-traded fund, it's usually a sector.It's like tech.You'll get the top 50 tech stocks like the Invesco QQQ.It's all NASDAQ companies, right?And that's what you're investing in, a pool of companies. With the Bitcoin ETFs and now with the Ethereum ETFs as well, and with gold ETFs, you have to hold the underlying asset as the asset management company.So in order to be able to offer these spot Bitcoin ETFs, all these big companies have to buy Bitcoin.Then they make a deal with Coinbase Commerce to custody and hold their keys, their Bitcoin.You see where this is going? And there are a lot of other companies involved in the process.And like they say, the brick and shovel aspect of crypto, Bitcoin, the blockchain, those are big tentacles.And they're going to keep growing because you cannot stop the adoption of tech and the evolution. Like they say, the brick and shovel aspect of crypto, Bitcoin, the blockchain, those are big tentacles.And they're going to keep growing because you cannot stop the adoption of tech and the evolution of what's going on with the future of money and the digital economy.It can't be denied.On a little aside here, James, California's Department of Motor Vehicles... announced a large-scale implementation on the Avalanche blockchain, successfully digitizing 42 million car titles as part of an ongoing effort by the state to modernize the title transfer process for California drivers and DMV representatives. Together, the three partners are building a DMV run blockchain to streamline the vehicle title transfer experience for California's 39 million plus residents.Now, what is this going to do?These digital titles will soon be claimable by vehicle owners through the DMV's secure mobile wallet app.You can do this in minutes using a verifiable credential. The escrow-like Avalanche blockchain smart contracts mediating the title transfer will allow consumers to track and manage their pink slip vehicle titles digitally, cutting down on trips to the DMV and the post office.And this is another example of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology may also provide an early warning system for lean fraud with its core function as an immutable ledger that bad actors cannot manipulate.What do you think about that?I think that's pretty interesting.I'd like to know a little more about that.Well, it's a prime example of us tokenizing everything.That's really what we're talking about is tokenizing, the tokenization of... of all assets, real estate, you name it, luxury watches, resorts.You're going to own little shares of all these different assets that are going to go from analog to to digital.And you might be saying, what is CryptoFits talking about?That's why the more you listen, the more you learn.We'll give you some resources to go check out as we walk down the path and the future of money together.Uncharted Waters, each episode of CryptoFits here on Money Radio. of the Redding Bitcoin Center.

Excited about having as a special guest today our friend from Northern California who is doing so much for the Bitcoin community and has really done his work in this space and has lived it, breathed it, and has so much great knowledge and connects in the biz.And so happy to have him join us here on Crypto Fits from Redding, California, the head of the Redding Bitcoin Center Group. Jed Powers.Good afternoon, Jed.Good afternoon, Jimmy.Thank you for having me.So great to have you on the air with us.We're excited about launching in Phoenix and a great community in Phoenix and very forward-thinking people who are paying attention to what's going on with the future of money.I know you were cued into what was happening in Music City this past weekend. Absolutely.Yes, it was very interesting.What's your takeaways, Jed?My takeaway is this event shows that Bitcoin now is too big to fail.You've got the ETFs that were rolled out in January.Now you have former president and then you have presidential candidates who are saying that they're going to put the U.S.on not a Bitcoin standard, but have a strategic reserve of Bitcoin to help right our fiat currency right and as we know right now the government the american government is liquidating about two billion dollars worth of silk road bitcoin that we see and as you know as well and you had on your former show when the president was speaking he's talking about also getting ross out of out of jail as well because he's in you know two life terms plus 40 years there was never anybody he wasn't charged with killing anybody nobody was ever killed it was He was running a website where people were buying drugs and things like that.So as far as I'm concerned, his website wasn't anything different than, say, Craigslist, whereas if you want to list something there, you can list some bad, nefarious items.But it's not Craig's fault that that's happening, right?So hopefully with all this that's happening, with this last conference and with Vivek speaking and Trump speaking, I think that... You know, as you can hear from the crowd, they were screaming because we've been waiting for this for years.Bitcoiners have been going to Congress for years and look, we need regulation.We want to keep this here in America.Let's build this here in America.And Trump is the only person that has said that, that saying we want Bitcoin made in America.So we need to we need to become the financial hub of this technology.No doubt about it.And, you know, a lot of people are still getting hip to what Bitcoin mining is about. and the important role that the Bitcoin miners play, which leads me to James.We got one more cut there from President Trump from the Bitcoin conference, cut number three.Let's play that, and then we're going to dig in on mining a little bit, Jed. and with low energy costs america will become the world's undisputed bitcoin mining powerhouse you'll be a bitcoin mining powerhouse you will not have to move your family to china you will not be moving to china As we implement these reforms, Bitcoin and crypto will grow our economy, cement American financial dominance and strengthen our entire country long into the future.Many Americans do not realize that the United States governor is among the largest holders of Bitcoin.Does anyone know that? How about that?The federal government is almost 210,000 Bitcoin or 1% of the total supply that will ever exist.But for too long, our government has violated the cardinal rule that every Bitcoiner knows by heart.Never sell your Bitcoin.That's right, isn't it?That's right. How did I figure that one?Never sell your Bitcoin.And so, as the final part of my plan today, I am announcing that if I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the Bitcoin the U.S.government currently holds or acquires into the future.We'll keep 100%.I hope you do well, please. This will serve in effect as the core of the strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.As you know... As you know, most of the Bitcoin currently held by the United States government was obtained through law enforcement action.You know that.And so as I take steps to transform that vast wealth into a permanent national asset to benefit all Americans, today I repeat my pledge to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served.It's enough.It's enough. President Trump spoke to the libertarian conference, uh, weeks ago.And that was a big, a big theme was, uh, was Ross and they, they had placards.Uh, they had all kinds of stuff, uh, all kinds of signs when he was speaking about Ross and, uh, president Trump made the announcement in front of the libertarians that he was going to, uh, deal with that as soon as he takes office.So that's interesting stuff.Let's talk about mining a little bit, Jed.Okay.Talk about the importance of Bitcoin mining in the process and exactly what is Bitcoin mining?Bitcoin mining is running specific computers.Nowadays, you can't run a regular computer.You have to run ASIC chips, application-specific integrated circuits, to mine Bitcoin.And what those do is you plug those in and you put in your address where you want any Bitcoin that is minted to go to.And what you're doing is your computer is reaching into what's called the mempool.It's the bucket of all the transactions that are happening right now.So if I send you, Jimmy Fitz, some Bitcoin from Jed Powers, that's going to create, you'll see my wallet address, and then you'll see the amount going to your wallet address. And a miner will grab that and start organizing transactions into the next block.If they hit the number that your computers are looking for, and it's a random number, so every computer is guessing, but it's set up so every 10 minutes somebody is going to solve that.So we get to mining.You reach in, grab a bucket or a handful of transactions out of the bucket, start organizing in a block.If you hit the block... The reward nowadays is 3.125 Bitcoin.The reward drops in half every four years.That's called the halving.Right.And it started at 50 Bitcoin, went to 25, went to 12.5, went to 6.25.And in April here, it just switched again to 3.125.And in another, you know, almost four years, it'll do it again.Every four years is the halving. We're going to continue, Jed.We're going to take a quick break.Crypto fits here on Money Radio.We'll be right back with Jed Powers from the Reading Bitcoin Center. Steve Geracher, after working in financial services for over 20 years, I finally confirmed what investors really want, including me.And it's simple.All they're asking for is 20% annual return with no risk and 100% liquidity.Here's the problem.A money market is safe and liquid, but offers almost zero yield.Mutual funds and ETFs are liquid with upside potential, but aren't safe. A carefully selected next generation index annuity through IQ Wealth may offer 10% ample liquidity, principal protection, and a lifetime income yield potentially double to triple that of quality bonds.By yielding more income using fewer dollars, our system allocates more money for you for capital growth.It's a winning combination.

Welcome back to Crypto Fits.I'm on the phone with Jed Powers from the Reading Bitcoin Center, California's only Bitcoin center.And I'm chuckling because I'm online and I'm looking at a post that Donald J. Trump did on Truth Social saying, just spoke at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee on Saturday.It was great.Get your Bitcoin sneakers now.These are limited edition. They are each numbered, and you can now pay with Bitcoin or your favorite crypto.Have fun.Go to GetTrumpSneakers.com before they're gone.They are gone.And he's got black, and he's got like an orange Bitcoin color, Jed.And on the box, it says Trump Crypto President that you get these sneakers in.It's sold out, okay?Wow, I'm not surprised. that he's calling them Bitcoin orange high top sneakers priced at four 99, a thousand pairs were available and they sold out in under three hours.Wow.Each, each pair was numbered and five lucky buyers get an autograph pair.And then those who want a different color, there are a thousand pairs in black for 300 bucks.And, uh, President Trump was encouraging people to buy these sneakers using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.And this ties into his broader embrace of the crypto movement, this election cycle, of course.But I thought you'd get a kick out of that.Let's continue the Bitcoin mining conversation real quick here, Jed, because it's such an important part of the process.How do you see now that we had the latest halving where you just said the supply of Bitcoin and the reward to the miners gets cut in half? How do you see that intersecting now with the launch of these spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January?The halving was in April.Historically, like I guess, what is it, 9 to 15 months after the halving that happens every four years, that's when Bitcoin gets the big surge, right? And what do they call it?The banana boat, the banana handle.Yeah.How do you see that this time?And what do you think the difference is, obviously, with all the attention on Capitol Hill on this space?I think that it's getting to the point where, like you said, the ETFs were launched in January.There was a time that they were chewing up about 10,000 Bitcoin a day. And you just alluded to the halving that happened in April.Well, now instead of 900 Bitcoin being a generated day, you have 450.So with the ETFs eating it all up, and if you look, I mean, I think BlackRock has almost 400,000 Bitcoin in their ETF now.And if those guys keep going, now you've got presidential candidates that are speaking out about Bitcoin.So that's going to drive more traffic right there.And... You're right.My calculation is about 12 to 18 months after the halving, Bitcoin is typically 5 to 10 times what it was right around the halving.And so I see that happening more and more, but it may be more violent swings upward with everything that's happening right now because the supply is so much less than it was.And the supply is getting eaten up on the exchanges right now.There's maybe... 1.2 1.3 million bitcoin that are actually tradable so when you hear i you know we have 93 percent of the the supply has been minted well you just have to do a couple of calculations and see that there's going to be a bunch of people like me that their coins are not on the exchange and they're not for sale we're going to have a supply shock soon that is is just going to melt people's faces when they see it they're going to see that hockey stick And they're going to wish they were in.Then FOMO is going to set in and fasten your seatbelts.Absolutely.You know, and Kathy Woods is right.Around 2030, mathematically, the price has to be around a million.You look at what it takes to secure the blockchain.And then by that time, you're going to be minting less than one coin per block.Right.So... I mean, that's a huge, huge amount of Bitcoin that's no longer available because the supply is now limited again.And in another four years, it's going to be cut in half again.And again, all the way up to 2040, 2140, roughly, the last original Satoshi will be minted.And then after that, it'll just be minor fees that secure the system.Right now, you have... But this is based on historical too, Jed.It's like we've never had all these asset companies trying to beat each other out because they need to hold the actual Bitcoin to be able to offer these ETFs.And if there's a supply shock, they're all going to be battling each other for the available supply, right?Correct.And everything I'm saying is based on everything being static as it is. Right now, right?But yeah, you do now have these ETFs.You're having the, you know, the having just happened.So that's going to drive scarcity more and more.And you're right.There's going to be a feeding frenzy.And you may see a time when you have, you know, $10,000 candles on the chart.You know?I know.It's coming.It's coming.If people are buying those ETFs, they have to, by law, back it up with Bitcoin.That's right.They have to. So, I mean, what does BlackRock have, $10 or $20 billion right now in Bitcoin?If they get another $10 or $20 billion, then they have to buy another $10 or $20 billion.But guess what?If the supply is being restricted even more in that supply shock, well, now you're going to have to incentivize people to sell their Bitcoin.And how you do that is it's a life-changing amount of money for them, right?And when they see it go up and they, wait a minute, I need to pay some bills.I can finally breathe now. You know, they'll use their Bitcoin, they'll spend it or they'll, you know, trade it for goods and services or for cash or whatever they need.So, yeah, that's the way I see it going.I think the supply shock is happening now.So, I mean, my model might be completely destroyed because of the supply shock may be greater than I think.Right.You may have other countries launching ETFs, other countries.Well, we know this.Yeah. We've got Hong Kong.Australia's already launched their Bitcoin ETFs.Right.Remember, it's a worldwide market.It's not just our little USA who's been trying to figure out the regulation, who's in the pool. The good, the bad, and the ugly, separating fact from fiction, trying to explain and orange-pill people into what Bitcoin is, that this is a computer protocol unlike any of the – one of the greatest inventions.And, of course, we both agree that Michael Saylor – has a certain way of being able to connect those dots micro strategies michael saylor who i'm sure you point to as well with your your students as to where they can what they should be watching and who they should be listening to and what what they can learn because as we both said uh it's"

         " It's towards the goal of eliminating and neutralizing Hamas's military capabilities.Bloomberg Middle East anchor Jumana Bersetchi says this latest killing leave ceasefire talks with Hamas even more uncertain. Nathan, this latest development out of Israel follows the two airstrikes this week that killed Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shuker in Beirut.Israel has not confirmed it was behind Haniyeh's death, but the New York Times reports Iran's supreme leader has ordered a direct attack on Israel in response.Secretary of State Antony Blinken is urging all sides to de-escalate.It all starts with a ceasefire. And to get there, it also first requires all parties to stop taking any escalatory actions.Despite that determination from Secretary of State Blinken, sources tell Bloomberg News that the Biden administration knows getting to a ceasefire is harder than ever after Ishmael Haniyeh's death. Turning to politics back home, Karen, former President Donald Trump was in Chicago for the National Association of Black Journalists conference, and he questioned Vice President Kamala Harris's racial identity.We get more from Bloomberg's Amy Morris in Washington. The former president got booed and some laughs when he said during a roundtable discussion that he questions Vice President Kamala Harris's racial identity.She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage.I didn't know she was black. until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black.Trump also defended old comments from his running mate, Senator J.D.Vance, that disparaged women without children as, quote, childless cat ladies, saying it was meant in a friendly manner.The National Association of Black Journalists says they're also in talks to have Vice President Harris virtually address their convention.Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio. All right, Amy, thank you.As Vice President Kamala Harris gets closer to picking a running mate, her team has met with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.Bloomberg's Ed Baxter has that story. They have said all along he's on the short list, which now includes Shapiro, Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and say that it was just part of the selection process and not to read anything into it.Sources as well say several unions have made their concerns known about Kelly.One, the Transport Workers Union, said he is not pro-trade union enough.In fairness, other unions have supported him. Harris did pick up the endorsement of the United Auto Workers, influential in Michigan.She plans to campaign with her pick next week.Ed Baxter, Bloomberg Radio.Okay, Ed, thanks.Let's turn back to markets now.The barrage of earnings around the world.We'll start with meta platforms.Those shares are up 6.5% in early trading.The Facebook owner reported better than expected sales in the second quarter.Investments in artificial intelligence are helping meta sell more targeted and personalized advertisements. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked about AI on the conference call.There are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time.It's because it's actually super exciting and it's going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms reported sales of $39.1 billion.That topped estimates by $800 million. Well, Nathan, while Zuckerberg's personal wealth will rise if those gains in meta shares hold, it may pale to the day NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang had.Shares of NVIDIA surged 13 percent yesterday.And we get more from Bloomberg's Doug Krisner.The rally was linked to an upbeat forecast from competitor Advanced Micro Devices, AMD's Outlook. pointed to improved demand for its AI accelerator, a market dominated by Nvidia.On Wednesday, Nvidia added a record $329 billion in value, and Wang's net worth was boosted by nearly $12 billion.He is now the world's 14th richest person, with a net worth of nearly $103 billion.He has been steadily capitalizing on Nvidia's outperformance this year.He sold shares worth nearly $169 million in June, the most he's netted in a single month. In New York, I'm Doug Krisner, Bloomberg Radio.All right, Doug, thanks.And high tech will remain in focus this afternoon when Apple and Amazon report earnings.But let's check some key results overseas this morning.Shares of Shell are up 1.2 percent.The oil giant posted second quarter earnings above analyst estimates and confirmed another $3.5 billion share buyback. Shares of Barclays were higher earlier.Now they're lower in London.The British lender reported better than expected income in the second quarter, aided by a surge in revenue from some of its Wall Street operations.Barclays will also repurchase as much as $963 million in shares. We turn to the U.S.economy, Karen, and more hints from the Fed that it could pull off a rate cut at its next meeting.J-PAL kept rates unchanged yesterday, but the Fed chair signaled officials are on course to cut in September unless inflation progress stalls. The question will be whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market.If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.Following Fed Chair Jay Powell's comments, interest rate swaps showed traders fully pricing in a quarter point cut in September and a total of almost 70 basis points in reductions for the year. Well, Nathan, rates also in focus overseas.The Bank of England makes a policy decision later this morning, and economists say there could be the first rate cut since the start of the pandemic.Investors are placing a 64% chance on a quarter point cut, taking the key lending rate from a 5.25% to 5%. And back on Wall Street, Karen, it is a blow for Bill Ackman.In just a matter of weeks, the Pershing Square founder's plan to steer a new investment fund onto the New York Stock Exchange has collapsed.Ackman bet his wide following on X could raise $25 million for Pershing in an initial public offering.That would have been an unprecedented feat for a closed-end fund in the U.S.Ackman later cut that target to $4 billion, then $2 billion.By yesterday, Pershing Square withdrew the IPO completely. It's time now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world.For that, we're joined by Bloomberg's John Tucker.John, good morning.Good morning, Karen.The man accused of being the main plotter in al-Qaeda's 9-11 attacks has agreed to plead guilty.That's according to the Defense Department.Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two accomplices in the attack are expected to enter the police at the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to avoid the death penalty. The U.S.agreement with the men comes more than 20 years after militants flew commandeered commercial airliners into buildings, killing nearly 3,000 people.Some family members of 9-11 victims say that's not justice.Andrew Ansborough is president of the Uniform Firefighters Association.They're allowing these three terrorists and mass murderers to continue to live while, on average, three New York City firefighters are dying every month. More than 340 members of the FDNY died in the attack on the World Trade Center.The U.S.says the world should acknowledge that Venezuela's opposition won last weekend's election against President Nicolas Maduro.Brian Nichols, the top U.S.diplomat for Western Hemisphere Affairs, spoke at a meeting of the Organization of American States in Washington. With the irrefutable evidence based on the actas, everyone can see it is clear that Armando Gonzalez Arrutia defeated Nicolas Maduro by millions of votes. Meanwhile, Maduro doubled down on his claims of victory, saying his opponent should be jailed for decades.The American Cancer Society says cancer rates are up for Gen X in millennials.According to the research published in the journal Lancet, they have a two to four times higher rate of specific cancers like pancreatic or kidney.The good news is the number of lung cancer and cervical cancer deaths are on the decline. 45% of American adults say they've been billed in the past year for medical care they thought was covered by insurance.According to a report from the Commonwealth Fund, it leaves many footing the bill for insurance company errors.Sarah Collins, one of the authors of the report from the Independent Health Research Foundation.When we asked them why they hadn't challenged, more than half said it was because they weren't aware that they had the right to do so. Collins says more than a third of those who challenged their medical bills got their balances reduced or eliminated.Global News, 24 hours a day, whenever you want it, with Bloomberg News Now.I'm John Tucker, and this is Bloomberg.Nathan and Karen.All right, John, thank you.

Good morning.I'm Nathan Hager.We are watching for the prospect of further tensions in the Middle East, with Israel now saying it has confirmed the death of Hamas's military chief, Mohammad Daif, in a strike in Gaza.That follows the strike this week that killed Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran.Joining us from Tel Aviv once again this morning is Bloomberg News Israel Bureau Chief Ethan Bronner.Ethan, good morning.What is the Israeli military saying specifically about the military commander's death? Hi, Nathan.So this is a hit that occurred actually more than two weeks ago.And at that time, the Israelis said they were pretty sure they got him.Hamas denied it.They said he's fine.He's laughing as he listens to Prime Minister Netanyahu claims to have killed him. Today, simply based on their ability to do some kind of intelligence assessment, the Israeli military has officially announced that DIF was eliminated on the 13th, I think it was, of July.So it's sort of coming on top of this other news, but it's not actually new.It's from two weeks ago. But still, for Israel to make that confirmation, I would think, is a pretty significant development when you think about where the leadership structure stands with Hamas now.The military chief, the second in command, eliminated.The political chief, the top leader of Hamas, eliminated.Does this bring Israel closer to its goal of eliminating Hamas as an organization? I think it does, but I think this is the eternal question about these guerrilla organizations and about the policy of targeted assassinations and so on.There's a kind of eternal battle of theories that you just create more terrorists when you go after them in this way. or no, yes, we can kill them, we can eliminate it, and it's very difficult for me to know where we're headed.There's no question that progress has been made, and a lot of progress in disassembling the military structure of Hamas.You know, another argument that is being mooted here is that this all of this action is a prelude to there being a a a ceasefire deal the netanyahu needs all of this kind of a chest beating in order to persuade the nation that it's okay to go ahead with a deal to get some hostages out and to create a ceasefire i don't know if that's true What I do know is that in the coming days, we're going to get hit in this country from some combination of Hezbollah, Iran, and the Houthis.It's almost inevitable. And with all that in the background, Ethan, we're continuing to hear this determination from the U.S.side, Secretary of State Blinken, on ceasefire talks progressing, tensions de-escalating.I mean, what is the prospect for ceasefire talks when we have this disarray in Hamas leadership?I mean, who's going to be in the talks at this point? Well, to be fair, it has always been only one negotiator who mattered, and that's Yahya Asinwar, who's the overall leader of Hamas, who's in a tunnel somewhere under Gaza.It's a complicated process to negotiate because the messages and the uh... communication have to go back and forth by hand they don't do it electronically there so uh... i mean to be honest honey up played a role of the man who was killed in tehran yesterday uh... but he was centrally doing the bidding of sin war so someone else for the bidding of sin war that doesn't strike me as the problem the problem is that i i think that they're going to pull back from these talks at least for a little while uh... in anger uh... and humiliation for what has just happened the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran with a precision guided missile of some kind.So that's likely.But what the U.S.is doing is going around talking to everyone and saying, let's keep the waters calm.Let's not let this devolve into a major regional war.And possibly what will happen is what happened in mid-April after Israel killed Iranian generals in Damascus.And there was a specific attack by Iran on the Israeli territory.But it looked, and I don't want to go too far in this direction, that it had been kind of signaled all around, that it was relatively clear what was coming when, so that it could make a symbolic gesture but not create a war.And maybe that's what we'll see again.I don't know. Well, we'll have to brace for whatever comes next following all these fast moving developments from where you sit, Ethan.Thank you for this.Ethan Bronner, our Israel bureau chief for Bloomberg News, joining us this morning from Tel Aviv.We want to turn now to U.S.politics and something of a shift we're seeing now in just the matter of a week or so with Kamala Harris now on top of the Democratic ticket. And Donald Trump looking to adjust.Joining us now for more on that is Terry Haynes, the founder of Pangea Policy.Terry, it's good to speak with you this morning.I wonder if we saw some evidence of the difficulty in that adjustment for former President Trump when he went before the National Association of Black Journalists and questioned his new opponent's racial identity as he's trying to reach out to black voters. Good morning, Nathan, and you certainly saw some evidence of Trump thrashing around here a little bit, I think.My thesis, which I certainly think continues valid, is that Trump's base does not equate to the entire Republican Party, where there's still a lot of holdouts among voters and luminaries alike, and he has difficulty reaching out to independents. That still holds, and I give him credit for being at the Black Journalist Convention when the vice president won't do it in person.But there's a situation here where he's playing a theme from an old playbook, but in this case, I think it backfires on him quite substantially.The kind of dog whistles about... about racial identity are meant to have black voters question whether or not the vice president's authentic enough and all that sort of business.But doing it in that forum, in that way, in front of journalists, frankly, make it more likely that black voters identify with her and want to see her win. Well, there was some thought after the assassination attempt against former President Trump that he might try to adjust his playbook.He even talked about trying to be a more unifying figure.I mean, do you see former President Trump adjusting his playbook in any significant way against Kamala Harris?One reason that I have Harris today tipped to barely win in November is is that I will always say that the Democrats will have superior message discipline.That's in part because they'll work hard to have message discipline, and in part because it will be difficult or impossible for the other side, for the other ticket, to have message discipline.And I think that's part of what we're seeing.Trump's thesis was that he could go sort of into the middle, be a little bit more presidential-like, and have Vance take on more of the attack dog role.This is a classic way of doing things in American politics.You saw this with President Nixon, for example.He was Eisenhower's attack dog, but he needed to become more presidential, so he assigned somebody else the attack dog role.But today, what they've got is a situation where where Vance is landing with a thud, generally speaking, not really able to reach out to the independent voters that they need, at least yet.I thought he was a mistake all along.And you've got Trump backsliding into combative mode.And what that does is it makes it much more difficult for them to actually kind of complete the task, if you will. I wonder what you think about the message discipline that we are seeing at this point from the Democratic side on Kamala Harris's side.Why do you think that we might not see as much message discipline from her, given what we have seen so far?A lot of focus on this idea that the Trump-Vance wing is weird.We keep hearing that a lot and many other lines from Harris as well. Well, what they want to do is, you know, part of Harris's goal here is to establish the views and the Democratic ticket generally, Harris plus whoever she gets, as the mainstream party.And, you know, in doing so, she's playing on the fears of folks who have blotted independence, that, you know, frankly, Trump is something – different structure in american politics and that the safer pick is to uh... is to go with harris frankly even if you don't uh... agree with everything harris wants to do so uh... you know by by kind of mainstreaming harris in this way uh... you know i think that's what they hope to achieve and i do think that uh... the harris you know you see this in her initial television commercials you see it in uh... and exactly how people are thinking or excuse me how people are talking that they're working hard to be very, very much on message in a very unified way, using the same phrases and all the rest.That comes off to people like you and me who look at this stuff constantly as a little robotic and overdone.But to people like former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina likes to say, pay attention to politics for four minutes a day, that's exactly the kind of discipline you need to go. Thanks, Terry.As always, Terry Haynes, founder of Pangea Policy, with us this morning.It's 523 on Wall Street. And I'm Karen Moscow.And S&P futures are higher after yesterday's powerful rally.This after meta platform sales beat, added fresh fuel to a rebound for technology companies.Meta platforms is up about 7% this morning.S&P futures up 0.2% of 12 points.Dow futures little change.Nasdaq futures up 0.3% or 61 points. 10-year Treasury down 7.30 seconds, yield 4.05%.Yield on the two-year, 4.28%.And NYMEX crude oil is up 1% at $78.70 a barrel.That's a Bloomberg Business Flash.Nathan.All right, Karen, thank you.It's coming up on 524 on Wall Street on a very busy Thursday morning.We want to get more now on the other major news for markets, the Fed decision and the pause from Chairman Powell and company, though it sounds like they're Keeping a September cut on the table, let's bring in Jennifer Lee for her analysis, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.Is that what you heard, Jen?Seemed like it from J-PAL, didn't it? Good morning, Nathan.Yes, thanks for having me on.And holy cow, I don't think I've ever heard him so clear in forever.I mean, it was almost like ECB-like, the way that all the hints that he was dropping at the press conference yesterday, you know, when he was saying that we're almost there.I mean, he was just, again, he was just, I mean, again, all the commentary that he was throwing out was very clear that, you know, that a September rate cut is on the table. In contrast to the statement in some ways, right?I mean, with that kind of signaling that we heard from Chairman Powell, even with the focus on the labor market, why not cut yesterday?What held him back? You know what, there's still time.I mean, the fact that we had a couple of weeks of pretty strong data or stronger than expected data.Again, they want to be certain.They don't want to look foolish by cutting too quickly.You know, they want to just make sure this is – and I think September is a good time, the reasonable time for that particular cut.But the fact that they discussed cutting rates that day, I thought was like that was – that threw me for a loop for sure, the fact that they were actually discussing let's do it today. shows that, you know, how comfortable that they've become and, you know, throwing it over to September.They can probably give a lot of stronger signals, I think, at the Jackson Hole confab coming up later on this month.So we'll be listening to that very carefully.But, you know, I think September is, you know, it looks like a done deal unless something crazy comes out of left field. Doesn't sound like you think something crazy is coming out of left field, but what are some potential risks to the Fed possibly getting thrown off track toward a September cut? Well, first of all, you never know what happens in the world today.But certainly we still have, I believe, three more inflation reports, two more CPI reports and one PCE report.And if we see those two inflation reports heading in the wrong direction, that will offset the three months of encouraging inflation reports that we've seen already. And that could throw them off.I mean, again, the U.S.economy remains very resilient.Is that our word again?It's not we're not seeing recession anymore at all.Obviously, resilience is still the key.And if you still see some pickup stubbornness in inflation in the next two couple of reports, that could totally throw them off of September.Only 30 seconds left, Jen, but give me a preview of tomorrow's jobs report.What do you think we're going to see? So we're looking for about 185,000 jobs.Slower growth, you know, certainly for what we saw in June was decent, but for the next couple of months, you know, we're definitely seeing a slowdown from what we saw in the first quarter.Jobless rate we have officially at 4.1%, so unchanged, but I think there's some upside risk just potentially given what we saw in the conference board survey yesterday where more people are saying that jobs are harder to come by. Earnings are still flat.So I don't think it's going to throw anything that's going to, I don't think anything in the report is going to throw off that September, that expected September cut.But it's going to show that softening in the labor market that will help support such a move.Thanks, Jen.As always, Jen Lee, Senior Economist, BMO Capital Markets.Up next, the latest from the Middle East, where Israel says it has taken out Hamas' second-in-command first today's Bloomberg weather forecast. Frontal system will be producing showers and thunderstorms today from the southern plains across parts of the Mississippi River Valley into the Ohio River Valley and Great Lakes.Some of these storms are going to be strong with high winds and heavy rainfall.Afternoon showers and thunderstorms are likely from the mid-Atlantic states into the southeast in Florida.Monsoonal moisture will continue to feed the showers and thunderstorms that develop later today across parts of the southwest and the southern Rockies.I'm Rob Carolin, Bloomberg Radio. Live from the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers Studio.Broadcasting coast to coast on Bloomberg Radio.On Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business App.And around the world on the Bloomberg Terminal and Bloomberg.com.This is Bloomberg Daybreak.We're coming up to 530 on Wall Street.Good morning.I'm Nathan Hager. And I'm Karen Moskow.We are just about four hours away from the open of U.S.trading.Let's get you up to date on the news you need to know at this hour.Israel says it has eliminated the head of Hamas's military wing.In a post on X, Israel's military says it has confirmed that Mohammed Def, Hamas's second-in-command, was killed in a strike in Gaza nearly three weeks ago.Bloomberg Israel Bureau Chief Ethan Brawner says he anticipates retaliation. Another argument that is being booted here is that all of this action is a prelude to there being a ceasefire deal.Netanyahu needs all of this kind of a chest beating in order to persuade the nation that it's okay to go ahead with the deal to get some hostages out and to create a ceasefire.I have no idea if that's true. What I do know is that in the coming days, we're going to get hit in this country from some combination of Hezbollah, Iran, and the Houthis.It's almost inevitable. Bloomberg's Ethan Bronner says it's unclear if this event brings Israel closer to its goal of entirely eliminating Hamas.But this event, Karen, comes after the airstrike this week in Iran that killed Hamas's political chief, Ismail Haniyeh.Now, Israel has not confirmed it was behind that attack, but the New York Times reports Iran's supreme leader has ordered a direct strike on Israel in response.White House National Security Spokesman John Kirby says cooler heads can still prevail. We believe that an escalation is inevitable, and there's no signs that an escalation is imminent.But I also said that we watch it very, very closely.Despite those words from White House spokesman John Kirby, people familiar with the Biden administration's thinking tell Bloomberg it has gotten harder than ever to reach a ceasefire after Hania's death. Turning to the race for the White House, Nathan, Donald Trump has questioned rival Kamala Harris' racial identity during a roundtable event with black journalists.The former president responded to a question about comments from his party, casting Harris as a, quote, diversity hire. She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage.I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black.So I don't know.Is she Indian or is she black?She is always identified as a black woman.I respect either one. Donald Trump made the comments yesterday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago.Well, Karen, Trump's political fortunes may be shifting in the market.Betting odds on predicted now have Vice President Harris at a 53 percent chance of winning in November.At one point, Trump's odds had been above 70 percent.That was before President Biden dropped out of the race.All this comes as Harris has wiped out Trump's lead in the Bloomberg News Morning Consult swing state poll. Turning to the economy now, Nathan, Fed Chair Jay Powell signaled that officials are on course to ease monetary policy next month unless inflation progress stalls.We got reaction from former New York Fed president and Bloomberg opinion columnist Bill Dudley.The market's already pricing in September with a high degree of certainty.What are you really waiting for at this point?Why take the additional risk of the economy deteriorating further? So, you know, at the end of the day, it's probably not going to make a lot of difference.But I think, you know, given the fact that the market expects the Fed to cut, once that decision is mostly made, and I think you heard today it was mostly made, then why are you waiting? Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley expects a unanimous vote for a quarter point rate cut in September.Well, Karen, the Fed's a hot topic for global investors trying to time interest rate cuts.But unusually, it is also a prominent feature on corporate America's post earnings conference calls.The words Federal Reserve were on track to be mentioned about 300 times. Well, Karen, the Fed's a hot topic for global investors trying to time interest rate cuts, but unusually, it is also a prominent feature on corporate America's post-earnings conference calls.The words Federal Reserve were on track to be mentioned about 380 times in the second quarter.That's according to a Bloomberg analysis of conference call transcripts of S&P 500 and stocks 600 companies.If that current pace holds, it would be the highest tally ever in records going back to 2001. And speaking of earnings, Nathan, shares of Meta are up about 7% in early trading.The Facebook and Instagram parent company reported better than expected sales in the second quarter.Apple and Amazon report this afternoon.It's a setback for a domestic chipmaker, Karen.Applied Materials has been informed by U.S.officials that it will not be receiving CHIPS Act money for a long-anticipated research and development center.AMAT had hoped to get U.S.funding for a $4 billion facility in California. through the program designed for large-scale chip manufacturing, but sources say the Commerce Department rejected applied materials after concluding that project didn't qualify. It's 532 on Wall Street.Let's bring in John Tucker with more on what else is going on in New York and around the world.John.And Karen, the man accused of being the main plotter of the September 11th terror attacks and two accomplices will reportedly plead guilty to avoid the death penalty.Some family members of 9-11 victims say that's not justice.Alice Yu worked on the 71st floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center and survived the attack.I'm thankful that they pled guilty.I mean, it's been so many years now. But I don't know what's the best punishment.The U.S.agreement with the men to enter into a plea agreement comes more than 20 years after the militants flew commandeered commercial airliners into buildings, killing nearly 3,000.The U.S.says the world should acknowledge that Venezuela's opposition won last weekend's election, while President Nicolas Maduro doubled down on his claims of victory, saying his opponents should be jailed for decades. Brian Nichols, the top U.S.diplomat for Western Hemisphere Affairs, says everyone can see it's clear that Edmundo Gonzalez defeated Nicolas Maduro by millions of votes.Meanwhile, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said President Maduro needs to publish the election results soon.Our patience and that of the international community is running out. It's running out on waiting for the Venezuelan electoral authorities to come clean and release the full detailed data on this election.The opposition leaders say they've overwhelming proof that Gonzalez is the rightful election winner, citing evidence from more than 80 percent of the country's polling stations Venezuela's electoral body said Maduro took about 51% of the vote.A new study from the American Cancer Society suggests Gen Xers and Millennials have a higher risk of developing 17 of 34 cancer types compared to earlier generations.Dr. Jonathan Lepook.It's important to know that about 4 in 10 cancer cases and 44% of all cancer deaths in adults 30 and older are linked to risk factors. economics finance investment we're risk averse and we're looking for perfection bloomberg surveillance with tom keen jonathan perot and lisa abramowitz what's the full year total return gonna look like the business news you need to start your day and the names that shape the world's markets richard claret a federal reserve vice chairman bloomberg surveillance weekday mornings at 7 eastern on bloomberg television the bloomberg business app and bloomberg.com can i rip up the script here check your local listings for the cable or satellite provider in your area David was in big trouble with the IRS.At first, I didn't owe that much, but after this year, it was out of control.Then David called Get a Tax Lawyer.Right away, they were like, oh yeah, looks like you're qualified to say s***.Get a Tax Lawyer went to work.Should have called way sooner.Get a Tax Lawyer has helped thousands like David fight the IRS and get a fresh start.Call 800-745-3070.That's 800-745-3070.

Morning, Nathan.Well, look, I mean, this has been the leadership group now for the better course of the past 18, 24 months.And I don't think it's ready to give up the mantle.However, what I would say, you know, that's probably being lost in the shuffle is the volatility of the market has just really picked up significantly in the last month.I mean, you know, these moves that we're seeing, this flip-flopping back and forth, you know, leadership and stuff, that's not a market, to me, that seems comfortable with all the things that are going on.And that's basically been our view as we went into July.I mean, we felt like earnings season, you know, would probably be a situation – this is the way it always is, by the way, in the third quarter – Earnings Revision Breath typically comes down seasonally this time of year.We're seeing the same thing now.We saw that kick off with kind of a rotation out of the large cap, mega cap stocks that have been the leaders into kind of this rotation into lower quality, small cap names because that's a place to maybe hide out.But that's not a good idea in our view. We think, you know, right now in a late cycle economy, which is where we are, the market is going to continue to pay up for quality and quality growth has been the place to be.But the problem with that is that the valuations just got out of bounds.So we're having a reset on the valuations.That makes sense to us.And we think that's probably going to continue as it typically does at this time of the year into August and maybe even in September.Does a reset of valuations lead us toward a correction in the market? Well, we're having it, and we're having it in name by name, and that's good.That's what you want to see.I mean, the valuations, this has been our call for quite a while.We don't subscribe to the view that we should be trading at a higher plateau of valuations because the Fed is cutting rates now.I mean, when the Fed starts cutting rates, sure, you get a boost on valuations short term, but usually it's short-lived because once the Fed starts cutting, then that you know thing to look forward to is kind of behind you so what it really comes down to now nathan is who can actually deliver on the earnings growth and we're seeing the separation of the winners and losers on that earnings profile meaning the companies that deliver on the growth that's being priced in get rewarded and the ones that don't you know get punished and so we think that this like this sort of alpha stock picking environment will persist, but it's not going to be a rising tide lifting all boats like it has been really since last October.So in a selective environment, Mike, what do you see outperforming?What do you see delivering on earnings expectations? Yeah, so we've actually been pivoting for the last two or three months.As you know, this year, I mean, the first quarter was that the economic growth was actually quite a bit better than expected.There was actually some concern that maybe inflation was getting out of hand again.We call it the no landing and, you know, that things are going to reaccelerate.That all changed in the second quarter, right?The economic surprises have been really to the downside, right? know not a recession by any stretch but clearly disappointing growth numbers and now we have inflation also coming down a little faster and that's weighing on you know stocks because you know essentially good news on inflation is almost bad news for growth And, you know, as I said, people have crammed themselves into the expensive high quality growth names.And we think now people are going to start rotating back towards what I call high quality defensives.And that has been an area that's lagged for a better part of 18 months.And that would be areas like utilities, staples, the reach, the boring parts of the market that have really underperformed because they've been kind of left behind.They tend to outperform as well going into the Fed's first rate cut. Are you thinking that when the Fed does commence rate cuts, that it's going to be a cycle, that it's going to be a steady track on rate cuts, or is it going to be choppy from here? Well, what I would say is we don't know.I mean, historically speaking, we have, I think, 11 Fed rate-cutting cycles going back to the early 80s, and it's a 50-50, basically, right?It's either a 50% chance that things kind of go smoothly and a 50% chance that it doesn't go smoothly because the Fed is cutting because they have to, not because they can or they have space to do that.I think for this year, the market's assumption is that they're cutting because they can, not because they have to.And I think that's right, but that can change quickly.So what we've been very focused on to determine this, Nathan, is what's going on with the consumer.The consumer is still 70% of the economy. And that score, I mean, to be quite frank, the consumer is slowing much more considerably than what people were anticipating.And what I'm focused on right now in particular is consumer services, right?So this idea that experiences over goods, that transition has been quite positive for the last, I would say, six to eight months.But that now is slowing.We're seeing numerous number of companies in this consumer services space have trouble with earnings. everything from airlines to hotels, some of the business services area.So we're seeing this slowdown now where it's a little bit different than what people were anticipating.And that, to us, is a warning flag that maybe the consumer is in a little bit more of a squeeze here than what people are modeling in their forecasts. Only got about a minute left, Mike.You mentioned volatility in the market.We're kind of seeing volatility in politics as well.The betting market's going back and forth between Trump and Harris.How does politics factor into your outlook? Yeah, I mean, politics is a tricky one.I mean, I think it probably gets more attention than it should at this time of the cycle, obviously, and it probably gets not enough attention at other times.And we've written extensively about this.We go back to 2016, even in 2020, we had the same view back then, but a different outcome, which is that we ultimately think the cycle and earnings will overcome the election outcome.And so that's what we're trying to stay focused on and be true to our work. which is that the market equity stock and stocks are going to care about where we are in the cycle.That's going to determine the multiple.And then from a stock standpoint, who can actually deliver on the earnings?It doesn't mean that politics don't matter in the outcome, but it's probably a bigger deal for 2025 and beyond to say who's in the White House and who's running Congress on policy.It's just right now, right, the cake is kind of baked on the next two quarters of earnings, no matter who's in office, because they can't change policy that quickly. Really appreciate the time this morning, Mike.Thanks again for being with us.Mike Wilson there for Morgan Stanley, the Chief Investment Officer and Chief U.S.Equity Strategist.Karen.

And I'm Karen Moscow.Futures are on the rise this morning with S&P futures up a third of a percent, up 20 points.Dow futures are little changed and Nasdaq futures are up half percent.We're about 92 points just after we got earnings from Meta Platforms.Meta Platforms shares up more than 7 percent in early trading.Ten-year Treasury down 6.30 seconds, yield 4.05 percent.The yield on the two-year, 4.28 percent. NYMEX crude oil is up 7 tenths of a percent at $0.58 at $78.49 a barrel.COMEX Gold up a tenth of a percent or $3.30 at $24.7640 an ounce.And the Euro 1.0782 against the dollar.That's a Bloomberg Business Flash.Nathan. Thanks, Karen.We're coming up to 5.56 on Wall Street.It's time for our daily Bloomberg Law Brief, exploring legal issues in the news today, looking at Warner Brothers Discovery suing the NBA for breach of contract after losing the league's latest 11-year media rights deal.The NBA is moving from Warner's TNT Sports to Disney. NBCUniversal and Amazon Prime Video in deals that could triple the league's broadcast income.Warner says the NBA did not accept its matching offer for one of the packages.Now the legal question is whether the media giant matched Amazon's offer.For more, Bloomberg's June Grasso speaks to entertainment and media lawyer Ronald Beanstalk, partner at Scorinci Hollenbeck. Are courts reluctant to force someone into a deal they don't want to be in?Yes.That's the simplest answer I can give.Yeah, that's a common discussion in entertainment properties.If an artist wants off a label, the judge is going to say, how are you guys getting along?Oh, terribly?Okay, now I want you guys back together.Shake hands.Come on.You can put it back.Never happens.It never happens that way.There's always some... override, similar to the theory here of certain games being split up.There may be an override on structure of money.There may be a way to, you owe two records to this person.Oh, you owe 12 episodes to the original production company. Yeah, we do that to get through the process so we don't kill the golden goose here.Entertainment properties take decades, if not lifetimes, to develop like this, and so nobody wants to hurt that.So I think that there are going to be ways we get this resolved that may not be in the standard methodology.I think there's going to be a lot of meetings in chambers.So you think that there might be a settlement before it goes to a jury or a judge makes a decision? I think there's a possibility there's going to be a series of work around to try to satisfy some immediacy for TNT.But I think eventually there's going to be a transition unless everything has gone wrong from the Amazon point of view in terms of. Where the match was and how you define match, it sounds like the timeliness was there, had an exclusive negotiation process that preceded it, and it sounded like something happened in that definitional process.Somebody says, we did it.The other side, NBA, is saying, no, you didn't do that.No, you didn't. Is it based upon the variable platforms and the extensive nature of the other digital platforms?It's hard to know.The redactions make it hard to know.Because at the end of the complaint, June, there is a series of redactions where it's effectively saying the Amazon offer, they figured a way around it.And that's the kind of language you see in the complaint.They found a way around it here.They did something here that wasn't in good faith.It's a bad faith effort to deprive TBS of its contractual rights. That's pretty hefty.Redacted in the complaint, we don't know what the language was, but they're saying they caused the match to be rejected.There has to be proof of that.What did they do?Where is that here?Where is that C-enter?What did they do?What was so crafty about these guys that they were able to convince them that they could get around the match right?That's redacted.We're going to have to go find out once this proceeding really gets rolling. And that's media lawyer Ronald Beanstalk speaking with Bloomberg's June Grosso.Catch more of that interview plus analysis of the latest legal news by subscribing to the Bloomberg Law Podcast or downloading the show at Bloomberg.com slash podcast.And attorneys, get the latest in AI-powered legal analytics, business insights, and workflow tools at BloombergLaw.com.With guidance from our experts, you'll grasp the latest trends in the legal industry, helping you achieve better results.For the practice of law, the business of law, the future of law, visit BloombergLaw.com.

Karen, we'll get back to markets in a moment, but we begin with developing stories in the Middle East where Israel says it has eliminated the head of Hamas's military wing.In a post on X, the Israeli military said it has confirmed Hamas's second-in-command, Mohammad Def, was killed in a strike in Gaza on July 13th.Bloomberg Middle East anchor Jumana Versace has the latest from Dubai.From Israel's perspective, it is a major disaster."

         " acts the israeli military said it has confirmed hamas's second-in-command mohammed def was killed in a strike in gaza on july thirteenth bloomberg middle east anchor jimana versace has the latest from dubai from israel's perspective it is eight major diplomatic crew for the israeli prime minister not to know because They have said from the very beginning that they wanted to exact revenge on the perpetrators of October 7 and on Hamas.And so from their perspective, this actually works towards the goal of eliminating and neutralizing Hamas's military capabilities.Bloomberg's Jamana Bersetchi says this latest killing leaves ceasefire talks with Hamas even more uncertain. And this latest development out of Israel, Nathan, follows the two airstrikes this week that killed Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukur in Beirut.Israel has not confirmed it was behind Haniyeh's death, but the New York Times reports Iran's supreme leader has ordered a direct attack on Israel in response.Secretary of State Antony Blinken is urging all sides to de-escalate. It all starts with a ceasefire.And to get there, it also first requires all parties to stop taking any escalatory actions.Despite that determination from Secretary of State Blinken, sources tell Bloomberg News that the Biden administration knows getting to a ceasefire is harder than ever after Ismail Haniyeh's death. Well, Karen, let's turn to politics back home now.Former President Donald Trump was in Chicago at the National Association of Black Journalists Conference, and there he questioned Vice President Kamala Harris's racial identity.Bloomberg's Amy Morris has more from Washington. The former president got booed and some laughs when he said during a roundtable discussion that he questions Vice President Kamala Harris's racial identity.She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage.I didn't know she was black. until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black.Trump also defended old comments from his running mate, Senator J.D.Vance, that disparaged women without children as, quote, childless cat ladies, saying it was meant in a friendly manner.The National Association of Black Journalists says they're also in talks to have Vice President Harris virtually address their convention.Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio. All right, Amy, thank you.As Vice President Kamala Harris gets closer to picking her running mate, her team has met with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.Bloomberg's Ed Baxter has that story. They have said all along he's on the short list, which now includes Shapiro, Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and say that it was just part of the selection process and not to read anything into it.Sources as well say several unions have made their concerns known about Kelly.One, the Transport Workers Union, said he is not pro-trade union enough.In fairness, other unions have supported him. Harris did pick up the endorsement of the United Auto Workers, influential in Michigan.She plans to campaign with her pick next week.Ed Baxter, Bloomberg Radio. Okay, Ed, thank you.Let's turn back to markets now.A barrage of earnings around the world.We'll start with meta platforms.Those shares are up 7% in early trading.The Facebook owner reported better than expected sales in the second quarter.Investments in artificial intelligence are helping Facebook sell more targeted and personalized advertisements.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked about AI on the company conference call. They're all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time.It's because it's actually super exciting and it's going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms reported sales of $39.1 billion, topping estimates by $800 million. Nathan, while Zuckerberg's personal wealth will rise if those gains in meta shares hold, it may pale to the day NVIDIA CEO Jensen Wong had.Shares of NVIDIA surged 13 percent yesterday.We get more from Bloomberg's Doug Krisner.The rally was linked to an upbeat forecast from competitor Advanced Micro Devices.AMD's outlook pointed to improved demand for its AI accelerator, a market dominated by NVIDIA. On Wednesday, NVIDIA added a record $329 billion in value, and Wang's net worth was boosted by nearly $12 billion.He is now the world's 14th richest person, with a net worth of nearly $103 billion.He has been steadily capitalizing on NVIDIA's outperformance this year.He sold shares worth nearly $169 million in June, the most he's netted in a single month.In New York, I'm Doug Krisner, Bloomberg Radio. Doug, thanks.High Tech will remain in focus this afternoon when Apple and Amazon report earnings.Checking some key results overseas, we're watching shares of Shell.They are up about 1%.The oil giant posted second quarter earnings above analyst estimates and confirmed another $3.5 billion in share buybacks.Barclays reported better than expected income in the second quarter, aided by a surge in revenue from some of its Wall Street operations.Barclays will also repurchase as much as $963 million in shares, and those shares are lower. And turning to the economy now, Karen, more hints that the Fed could pull off a rate cut at its next meeting.Jay Powell kept rates unchanged yesterday, but the Fed chair signaled officials are on course to cut in September unless inflation progress stalls.The question will be whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market. If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September.Well, after those comments from Fed Chair Jay Powell, interest rate swaps showed traders fully pricing in a quarter point cut in September at a total of almost 70 basis points in reductions for the year. Well, Nathan, rates are also in focus overseas.The Bank of England makes a policy decision later this morning, and economists say there could be the first rate cut since the start of the pandemic.Investors are placing a 64 percent chance on a quarter point cut, taking the key lending rate from five and a quarter percent to five percent. Well, chances for Bill Ackman scoring an IPO have fizzled, Karen.In just a matter of weeks, the Pershing Square founder's plan to steer a new investment fund onto the New York Stock Exchange has collapsed.Ackman bet his wide following on X could raise $25 million for Pershing in an initial public offering.That would have been unprecedented for a closed-end fund in the U.S.But Ackman later cut that target to $4 billion, then $2 billion.By yesterday, Pershing Square withdrew its IPO completely. Time now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world.And for that, we're joined by Bloomberg's John Tucker.John, good morning.Good morning, Karen.The man accused of being the main plotter in Al-Qaeda's 9-11 attacks has agreed to plead guilty.This according to the Defense Department.Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two accomplices in the attack expected to enter the pleas at the military commission at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to avoid the death penalty. Some family members of 9-11 victims say that's not justice.Andrew Ensborough is president of the Uniform Firefighters Association.They're allowing these free terrorists and mass murderers to continue to live while on average three New York City firefighters are dying every month. More than 340 members of the FDNY died in the attack at a World Trade Center.The U.S.says the world should acknowledge that Venezuela's opposition won last weekend's election against President Nicolas Maduro.Brian Nichols, the top U.S.diplomat for Western Hemisphere Affairs, spoke at a meeting of the Organization of American States in Washington. With the irrefutable evidence based on the actas, everyone can see it is clear that Armando Gonzalez Arrutia defeated Nicolas Maduro by millions of votes.Meanwhile, Maduro doubled down on his claims of victory, saying his opponent should also be jailed for decades.The American Cancer Society says cancer rates are up for Gen X in millennials.They have a two to four times higher rate of specific cancers like pancreatic or kidney.Dr. Jonathan Laporte.

Okay, John, thank you.To 612 on Wall Street.We want to get right back to our top story now.Israel saying it has confirmed the death of another key Hamas leader in a strike in Gaza.Joining us from Dubai is Bloomberg Middle East anchor Jumana Bersetchi.Jumana, good morning.What are we hearing from the Israeli military? Yeah, that's right.A short while ago, the IDF put out a statement confirming that Mohamed Daif, who is Hamas's second in command, had been killed in a strike that was administered on July 13th.So this was a couple of weeks ago.Initially, when there were reports that he may have been assassinated from a few weeks ago, Hamas denied it.But today, IDF have put out a statement saying that he was indeed killed in that strike.So that would mark the second senior leader of Hamas that has been taken out in the last 24 hours.Of course, Israel so far have not confirmed that they were behind the airstrike that killed Ismail Hani, although they have not categorically denied it either.But as far as Mohammad Daif is concerned, he is the most senior military commander that has been killed since the beginning of the war in October 7.He was viewed as one of the key October 7 orchestrators.He even pre-recorded a speech announcing the attack before October 7 took place.So a very senior figure within the party and a key target for Israel.In fact, the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant has said that the strike that killed Daif was a significant milestone towards achieving the goals of the war. implying that the goals of the war have not been achieved yet.Where does this leave Hamas leadership now with these two senior figures off the table? Yep.I mean, it's a really big question that many people have been asking.Also worth pointing out that the actual acting figurehead, the leader of Hamas, is still in Gaza.That's Yahya Sinwar.And there was actually a bit of political rivalry between him and Ismail Hani, who was taken out yesterday.And so the question is whether Yahya Sinwar wants to continue with those ceasefire discussions.If you look at the internal politics within Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh was being represented as the side of Hamas, the faction of Hamas who actually did have an inclination to continue with these ceasefire talks and perhaps get towards the truth.Whereas Ismail Haniyeh, who's still on the ground, sorry, apologies, Yahya Sinwar, who's still on the ground in Gaza, is more reluctant to continue with the dialogue.So it is very difficult to see at this point who will be negotiating on behalf of Hamas.And the second point is whether there is appetite on Hamas all parts to continue with these discussions.And even though diplomats from the US to France to Germany are very keen to push forward these discussions, it's very difficult to see how there is going to be a path forward. And to that point, Jumana, we've heard the reports from the New York Times that Iran's supreme leader has ordered a direct strike on Israel in response to Ismail Haniyeh's death.What is the risk of further escalation of tensions now that we do have this confirmation that another key figure for Hamas, Mohammad Daif, has been eliminated as well? Yes, so the clue was in the initial commentary that came out of Iranian officials yesterday.Even though it was President Pesach Kian's first day on the job, he was very quick to come out with harsh words promising retaliation on anyone who commits acts of terror on Iranian territory.And the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Iran would be looking to seek revenge.This New York Times report came out overnight. saying that he has in fact ordered a direct attack on Israel and that military commanders are considering another combination attack of drones and missiles on military targets in Tel Aviv and Haifa, similar to actually what we saw back in April.So they are perhaps looking to telegraph it, which at the time, as we know, many of those drones and missiles, practically all of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome.But you also want to keep on your mind, the situation in Lebanon as well, because, as you know, another very senior commander was assassinated in Beirut a couple of days ago.And today, the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan al-Sarallah, will be giving a speech at 5 p.m.local time.So it'll be interesting to see what he has to say about a potential retaliation as well.Our last minute, Juma, are we seeing any signs from Israel that it's bracing for further attacks? From what we understand, they are bracing themselves for the likelihood of a retaliation, although at this point, the diplomatic channels have been working very hard.We've heard from the likes of John Kirby, from U.S.Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that there are two major objectives right now. Number one is to bring down the temperature in the region and to de-escalate the tensions that have risen the last couple of days.And number two is to try to push forward the ceasefire talks.So everybody is on edge, but it does seem as though the quote unquote axis of resistance that is powered by Iran are looking for retaliation.Whether it's going to tip over into a full blown war or a full blown escalation is the question on people's mind.But certainly there's a lot of nervousness. Bloomberg Middle East anchor Jumana Versace with us from Dubai this morning.Jumana, thank you.We'll be continuing to watch for a potential reaction in the commodities markets as well with NYMEX crude up about six-tenths of one percent right now and Brent, the international benchmark, up six-tenths one percent as well, trading above $81 per barrel.Yields are moving just a touch higher this morning after the Fed kept rates on hold but signaled that a September cut Looks like it could be on track.Let's bring in Amanda Lynham for some analysis of what we're seeing in terms of rates markets.Amanda's head of macro credit research at BlackRock.Thanks for being with us this morning, Amanda.So what's your read on what we heard from Chairman Powell and company?Some adjustments to the statement, but Powell really sounded like he wants to cut, or am I wrong? good morning nathan thank you for having me i i would absolutely agree with that some minor tweaks to the statement i think perhaps the most important change to the statement was the acknowledgement that they are attentive to both sides of their dual mandate risk of maximum employment and price stability as you know as recently as the june meeting that had been more focused on inflation So I think they are acknowledging that there has been, as Chair Powell put it, normalization in the labor market.But he was explicit that he did not want to see material further cooling.So I thought that that was important.We do view the path for forward monetary policy is on track for a September cut, presuming no major upside surprises in inflation.But even there, Chair Powell was very clear, as President Lagarde has said also, that they would be data dependent, not data point dependent.So I think they are building in a bit of flexibility there.But in general, I think the one thing that we wanted to hear was some guidance on the pace of rate cuts or potential rate cuts.Chair Powell acknowledged that they could either hold or cut, but really wouldn't give any guidance on the pace of rate cuts beyond saying that 50 basis points obviously wasn't something that they were considering at the time. And I thought actually the commentary on the labor market and the anecdotal evidence, those are probably two of the things that have been most top of mind for our investors.First, Chair Powell said that he really did view the rebalancing in the labor market as normalization, not outright weakness.As you know, he gave a range of indicators. to support that.And so I thought that that was notable, that basically they have not been overly concerned about what they've seen so far in the labor market.But again, they don't want to see more cooling.And then on the anecdotal evidence that was asked during the Q&A about softening in the economy, I thought Chair Powell's response was very interesting.He said that while there are pockets of weakness, he pushed back on the idea that that the anecdotal evidence was uniformly negative.He instead characterized it as mixed.This is important for our market of corporate credit, because as we've all seen, there have been a range of consumer facing companies in the second quarter earnings results that have talked about a more choiceful consumer, a value conscious consumer, more discerning on spending, making tradeoffs and what they're prioritizing. And he really did push back against that being across the board negative.And he talked about his discussions with even Fed governors and Reserve Bank presidents in addition to the Beige Book commentary.So that's probably, I would say, the big thing that we're going to be watching going forward.As it stands for corporate credit, not a ton has changed in terms of. What we are expecting, barring a sharp downturn in growth, which is not our base case, we're expecting a gradual normalization cycle of rate cuts, not a sharp easing cycle.So that means that borrowers are unlikely, both on the corporate and consumer side, to experience material near-term interest rate relief.And it really puts the onus on growth down. to remain at least trend or above to allow corporates to navigate this higher cost of capital environment while keeping margins somewhat in check.The good news is we are tracking at an above trend pace.The Atlanta Fed GDP is tracking for the third quarter of 2.8 percent.We were at 2.8 percent in the second quarter as well.So I would characterize that as so far so good.But it's really, really important to watch the labor market and the growth backdrop, I think, going forward. Absolutely.And so we'll be watching the jobs report tomorrow, particularly in our last minute.Amanda, with all that in the backdrop, is it a soft landing for yields?Where do you buy into the curve? Well, it's a great question.Yields have definitely been retreating, although I'm not sure that we see material tightening in yields from here, especially at the long end, given some of the fiscal concerns, deficit spending, supply issues on the horizon.I think yesterday's move may have had a bit to do, especially in the afternoon, with some of the geopolitical headlines.It's unclear how much of that we can directly attribute to the Fed. And I think we should be expecting a bit more disinversion from here.So some modest declines in the front end, which is very sensitive to the policy rate.But I think our base case is really for the long end.So call it the 10 to 30 year point of the curve. to stay somewhat range bound or even drift a bit higher as we get closer to year end.And I think building in some expectations for additional term premium is prudent here.So I wouldn't be expecting material tightening and long end yields.What that means for corporate credit investors is that really, if you're allocating capital, you're doing so on the basis of attractive all in yields historically and carry not necessarily total return catalyzed by the Treasury yield move. Thanks so much, Amanda.Really great having you on with us this morning after the Fed.Amanda Lynham, head of macro credit at BlackRock.Karen? Nathan, it is 6.23 on Wall Street, and we want to get more now on the latest tech earnings, a better-than-expected print for meta platforms.On signs that artificial intelligence is helping to sell more targeted ads, Bloomberg Intelligence Technology Analyst Matthew Bloxam is back with us.Matthew, good morning.Hi.Well, Matthew, we're watching meta shares.They're rising in early trading up more than 7%.That's stock up 34% year-to-date.What did investors take away from this report? Yeah, I think a few things to highlight.You know, first up, the revenue in the quarter was a little bit better than expected.It grew about 22% year on year.Now, most of that revenue is advertising.And just generally, the global advertising market is proving to be a bit more buoyant than earlier expectations in 2024.And, you know, most of that spend goes on digital platforms.And Meta is a really important digital platform, you know, that they're... average family service users grew to almost 3.3 billion, up about 6.5% year-on-year.So, you know, they're kind of continuing to attract users to the platforms and the AI technology they've been investing in is helping them to serve more targeted content to users and that's helping them to kind of drive better returns for advertisers. the average price per ad was up 10% year-on-year, which is an encouraging trend.I think beyond that, they continue to invest really heavily in AI platform infrastructure, and they kind of narrowed CapEx guidance towards the higher end of the existing range.I think people were relieved that they didn't move the top end of the range higher, so they're still spending a lot, but Not more than expected, but capital spending, particularly on AI, will continue to be strong into next year, too.And, you know, there's a very clear message from Mark Zuckerberg that maybe they are spending more than they have needed to in hindsight.But there's a bit of an AI arms race and a bigger preference to invest more. more today than they might need to, to kind of protect and develop a strong position as these markets evolve over the next kind of 10 to 15 years.But, you know, clear message that AI is going to be a really important part of their product roadmap over the next decade or so.Well, you did mention that AI arms race, and they did unveil the Lama AI model earlier this month.So what are the possibilities for that?Can it take on OpenAI and Google? Yeah, you know, I think it's a really important part of the AI jigsaw and, you know, particularly the fact that it's open source.So, you know, I think we're kind of seeing these kind of proprietary and open source models kind of finding their own place in the market.You know, lots of companies are using models like Lama to train their own data and kind of use them in the way that kind of meets their needs more. quite specifically.So, yeah, I think, you know, they're a very strong player in that marketplace.They're putting a lot of money behind its development.So I think it's going to be a kind of a really important large language model in the market over the midterm.All right, Matthew Bloxham, thank you so much for joining us and looking at MetaPlatforms for us this morning.MetaPlatforms shares are up more than 7% in early trading.Nathan. And Karen, that's tracking the broader market gains as well.NASDAQ futures leading the way with a four tenths of one percent gain.S&P futures up almost four tenths of one percent.And Dow futures with a gain of one tenth of one percent.Up next, we're going to get the latest from the Middle East, where Israel says it has taken out Hamas's second in command.Plus, the shifting political landscape as former President Donald Trump adjusts to Vice President Kamala Harris.That's coming up in our 630 News.First, today's Bloomberg weather forecast.

Nathan, Israel says it has eliminated the head of Hamas's military wing.In a post on X, Israel's military says it's confirmed that Mohammed Def, Hamas's second-in-command, was killed in a strike in Gaza nearly three weeks ago.Bloomberg Israel Bureau Chief Ethan Brawner says he anticipates retaliation. Another argument that is being mooted here is that all of this action is a prelude to there being a ceasefire deal.Netanyahu needs all of this kind of a chest beating in order to persuade the nation that it's okay to go ahead with a deal to get some hostages out and to create a ceasefire.I have no idea if that's true. What I do know is that in the coming days, we're going to get hit in this country from some combination of Hezbollah, Iran, and the Houthis.It's almost inevitable. Bloomberg's Ethan Bronner says it's unclear if this event brings Israel closer to its goal of entirely eliminating Hamas.And Karen, confirmation of that event comes after the airstrike this week in Iran that killed Hamas's political chief, Ismail Haniyeh.Israel has not confirmed it was behind that attack, but the New York Times reports Iran's supreme leader has ordered a direct strike on Israel in response.White House National Security Spokesman John Kirby says cooler heads can still prevail. We believe that an escalation is inevitable, and there's no signs that an escalation is imminent.But I also said that we watch it very, very closely.Despite those words from White House spokesman John Kirby, people familiar with the Biden administration's thinking tell Bloomberg it has gotten harder than ever to reach a ceasefire after Hania's death. Well, Nathan, we want to turn to the race for the White House now.Donald Trump has questioned rival Kamala Harris's racial identity during a roundtable event with black journalists.The former president responded to a question about comments from his party casting Harris as a, quote, diversity hire. She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage.I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black.So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?She is always identified as a black woman.I respect either one. Donald Trump made the comments yesterday at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago.Meanwhile, Karen, Trump's political fortunes may be shifting in the market.Betting odds on predicted now have Vice President Harris at a 53 percent chance of winning in November.At one point, Trump's odds had been above 70 percent.That was before President Biden dropped out of the race.All this as Harris has wiped out Trump's lead in the Bloomberg News Morning Consult swing state poll. Turning to the economy now, Nathan, Fed Chair Jay Powell signaled that officials are on course to ease monetary policy next month unless inflation progress stalls.We get a reaction from former New York Fed President and Bloomberg opinion columnist Bill Dudley.The market's already pricing in September with a high degree of certainty.What are you really waiting for at this point?Why take the additional risk of the economy deteriorating further? So, you know, at the end of the day, it's probably not going to make a big bit, but a lot of difference.But I think, you know, given the fact that the market expects the Fed to cut once that decision is mostly made, and I think you heard today it was mostly made, then why are you waiting?And former New York Fed President Bill Dudley expects a unanimous vote for a quarter point rate cut in September.Well, Karen, the Fed's been a hot topic for global investors trying to time interest rates, but unusually, it is a problem. And I think you heard today it was mostly made.Then why are you waiting?And former New York Fed President Bill Dudley expects a unanimous vote for a quarter point rate cut in September. Well, Karen, the Fed's been a hot topic for global investors trying to time interest rates, but unusually it is a prominent feature as well on corporate America's post-earnings conference calls.The words Federal Reserve were on track to be mentioned about 380 times on second quarter calls.That's according to a Bloomberg analysis of transcripts of S&P 500 and Stocks 600 companies.If that current pace holds, it would be the highest ever tally in records going back to 2001. And speaking of earnings here, Nathan, shares of Meta, they are up more than 7%.This morning, the Facebook and Instagram parent company reported better than expected sales in the second quarter.Apple and Amazon report this afternoon.And Karen, Applied Materials has been told it's not going to get chipsacked money for a long-anticipated research and development center.The company had hoped to get U.S.funding for a $4 billion facility in California through that program designed for large-scale chip manufacturing, but sources say the Commerce Department has rejected it after concluding the project did not qualify.And that's some of the things you need to know to start your day brought to you by Interactive Brokers. 6.33 on Wall Street, we bring in John Tucker with more on what else is going on in New York and around the world.John.And Karen, the man accused of being the main plotter of the September 11th terror attacks, and two accomplices will reportedly plead guilty to avoid the death penalty.Some family members of 9-11 victims say that's not justice.Alice Yu worked on the 71st floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center and survived the attack.I'm thankful that they pled guilty.I mean, it's been so many years now.

Yeah, our colleagues reported that from the U.S.perspective, while they want ceasefire conversations to continue, it seems like a short term, at least a short term setback, given the news early Wednesday that Israel killed the political chief for Hamas, who had been involved in the negotiations so far.Combining that with the confirmation that Hamas is second in command, was killed in a strike in Gaza on July 13th.It doesn't look like they're near the finish line in terms of getting to a ceasefire.That doesn't necessarily change the US's stance in favor of a ceasefire or its particular strategies in terms of trying to push for one. But those pieces of news seem to be a near-term setback.And you also see it reflected in some commentary from, for example, Egypt, which has been involved as a mediator, saying that in Egypt's perspective, the absence of political will from Israel to calm the situation is a setback.So it makes things difficult, in fact, more difficult in the near term, the recent developments, including the death of Hamas leaders. Let's talk about some of the latest developments in the political race.It seems like things have shifted so quickly now that Vice President Harris is on top of the Democratic ticket.And it looks as though former President Trump, or you can tell me if I'm wrong, is kind of struggling to adjust the message now that President Biden is no longer his opponent. Yes, he clearly is struggling to adjust to a new opponent.For Trump to go yesterday to the National Association of Black Journalists and claim falsely that Vice President Kamala Harris has only recently publicly identified herself as black... was a pretty bizarre decision.It's not true.She went to an HBCU.It's pretty common knowledge that she is black and also of Indian descent.It seems to show the former president struggling with his messaging and what to make of a new opponent. And it seems to raise question about the strategic decisions of even going to the NABJ event.Trump seems sort of preoccupied lately with some of the gains he's made in polling among black voters.But that doesn't necessarily mean it's a logical idea. to go to the NABJ and make false claims about your opponent's ethnic origins.So it's an example, an anecdote of a struggle for the Republicans to figure out how to run against a new opponent who is making gains in the polls and in fundraising. Yeah, as we saw in the Bloomberg News Morning Console poll, wiping out former President Trump's lead, going up by one percentage point, but still dead heat now in those seven swing states.In our last minute, Jack, the veep stakes continues.Apparently, Vice President Harris's team has been meeting with candidates.But what's labor's beef with Mark Kelly? There's been some skepticism for a while from a labor perspective with Mark Kelly.Part of that is he didn't co-sponsor the PRO Act, a high-profile bill with a lot of support on the labor side that would essentially make it easier for a lot of people to join labor unions. uh that combined with coming from a sunbelt state with a little less of the labor sway in its politics in arizona has always led to some skepticism and when you compare him to josh shapiro the pennsylvania governor tim waltz the governor of minnesota it's kind of become clear that at least specifically from a labor perspective Mark Kelly is not the favorite of the possible VPs to Kamala Harris.So that seems to put a bit more of a spotlight on Josh Shapiro, who recently met with Harris's representatives and seems to be certainly strong in the running for the position.

Markets, headlines, and breaking news 24 hours a day on Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg Television, and the Bloomberg Business App.This is a Bloomberg Business Flash. And I'm Tara in Moscow, and we've been watching earnings cross the Bloomberg, and we'll get to them in just a moment.But first, we're looking at futures as they move higher on this first trading day of August.S&P futures up four-tenths of a percent, up about 22 points.Dow futures up a tenth of a percent, or 50 points.Nasdaq futures up half a percent, or 86 points.The DAX in Germany is down eight-tenths of a percent.The 10-year Treasury down 4.30 seconds.The yield 4.04%.Yield on the two-year, 4.27%. NYMEX crude oil is up nine-tenths of a percent, up 68 cents at $78.59 a barrel.COMEX Gold up a quarter percent or $6.30 at $24.78, 80 an ounce.The euro, 1.0781 against the dollar.British pound, 1.2768.The yen, 150.02.And Bitcoin, it's little changed at $64,500.And that's a Bloomberg Business Flash. Sure is.Thanks, Karen.6.56 on Wall Street.Time to take a look at individual stocks to watch on what is another very busy pre-market for Bloomberg's Jess Menton.Lots of earnings, as Karen mentioned this morning, but the story we've got to continue to watch is the earnings from overnight.Of course, that would be meta platforms.That's right.Good morning, Jess.Good morning, Nathan, especially after the S&P 500 is coming off of its best Fed day since July 2022 yesterday, rising 1.6%. Of course, starting off with Meta, just for Tom Keen, because we know he wants to hear about this.META is the ticker symbol on this.Up 6% here.Obviously, this company is housed in the communication services sector in the S&P 500, as well as Alphabet.They're not in the tech sector.Just a reminder to keep an eye on that sector today.But that share rising 6% ahead of the opening bell after delivering second quarter revenue.That did beat analysts' estimates.Also, its AI advancements are improving ad recommendations and, in turn, boosting its revenue there. But if you look actually at the comp function, that stock's up 434% through yesterday's close since it hit that low in November of 2022 when it did unveil that big tranche of cost-cutting efforts.So they're trying to keep the metaverse in the horizon.Got a lot of earnings this morning in the pharma space as well. That's right.So Moderna, MRNA is the ticker symbol on this, down 13% here.So obviously seeing that stock coming under pressure.And also I wanted to point out, though, if you look at when it last hit its high in August of 2021 here, that stock's actually down roughly 75% off of that.So clearly that stock coming under pressure, of course, on the back of its results today. We also got results just crossing the tape from Biogen.Kind of a different story there, maybe?It is.So if you look at Biogen, actually boosting its fiscal year adjusted EPS forecast right now.So you're seeing that stock supported there.It sees adjusted EPS around $15.75 here to $16.25.It actually saw $15 to $16 there.So obviously seeing a boost here for that stock as well. So let's get back to some tech names because besides Meta, whether you're going to call it tech or not, we did get some other earnings from some other tech names.What are you watching?So I'm looking at the U.S.listed shares of ARM.So ARM is the ticker symbol on this for that 80-yard down. about 9% ahead of the opening bell.So the chip company did hold off on boosting its annual forecast, also raising concerns there that it's not confident in future growth prospects.The stock's actually gained about 92% before the plunge.Also, it IPO'd last September, so it's climbed more than 180% since then, Nathan. And you've got Carvana on your list?Of course.Another one I'm sure Tom Keenzy goes to hear about.CVNA is the ticker symbol for Carvana.Up actually 13%.So it did report revenue for the second quarter that beat average analyst estimates here.But also just a reminder, Carvana almost went out of business in 2022, but has staged an impressive turnaround.Actually is up about 3,500% from that December 2022 low after obviously the company announced a deal with bondholders to reduce its debt by about $1.2 billion. Yeah, so those car towers are going to stick around at least a while longer.Thank you, Jess.As always, Jess Benton of Bloomberg News tracking stocks to watch for us this morning.Don't know if any Ferraris are going to be in the Carvana Tower, but Ferrari reported earnings just in as well.Raising the full year guidance.Race is the ticker in Milan. And the shares are higher by about 4% after that guidance raise.Futures are higher as well.This is Bloomberg Daybreak.I'm Nathan Hager alongside Karen Moscow.6.59 on Wall Street.Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene, Paul Sweeney, and John Tucker starts right now.KFNN, Mesa, Phoenix.Bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg Business Act.This is Bloomberg Radio. This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Paul Sweet.Apple's still minting more money than God, right?Geopolitics front and center for global Wall Street.With Lisa Mateo on markets.That's coming off another record high.And Michael Barr with news.U.S.Secretary of State discussed the conflict in Gaza.The best in economics, finance, investment, and international relations.This is Bloomberg Surveillance on Bloomberg Radio. Good morning, everyone.Tom Keene, Paul Sweeney, Michael Barr, Lisa Matteo, various and sundry.Not in today because it's August 1.John Tucker joining us today, which is a good and wonderful thing.Thrilled to have him in here.News just coming out.The news flow, it's like they promised me it'd be like a summer week.No.No. Out moments ago, Bank of England and Governor Bailey, they cut their key interest rate a quarter of a point to 5%.This is a huge deal for England with their political turmoil, with the banks studying the disparity, the polarity of the United Kingdom between a prosperous London and as a generalization, everything else flat on their back.What I love about it, we'll talk to Anna Wong about this in a minute.Oh, yeah.BOE says five voted to cut rates.It's like a Supreme Court ruling.I know. Four said, are you kidding me?I went to Chicago.You're not cutting rates.That's basically what happened at the Bank of England.Anyways, we'll cover that.We have just an incredible show this morning.Paul, I've got a half hour with Richard Clarida in the 8 o'clock hour, the former vice chairman of the Fed.What do you see? That's pretty solid right there.So we're going to check in.Anna Wong is going to be in studio, Tom.So that's pretty solid there.Rob Sockin, global economist at Citi.He's going to discuss what central banks around the world are up to.Again, the Bank of England cutting rates.The Fed suggesting maybe September?Suggesting.So we'll leave it at that.We'll leave it as a suggestion.Right now, from the Interactive Broker Studios, our Bloomberg Business Flash, John Tucker. Banks around the world are up to, again, the Bank of England cutting rates, the Fed suggesting maybe September?Suggesting.So we'll leave it at that.We'll leave it as a suggestion.Right now, from the Interactive Broker Studios, our Bloomberg Business Flash, John Tucker.Yeah, BOE, first reduction since the early days of the pandemic, ends a year of borrowing costs at 5.25%.The initial reaction, we have Sterling down about 7 tenths, 127.71 right now. Stocks in the U.S.did see that Fed-fueled surge.Powell signaling central bank on course to cut interest rates in September, sending stock and bond prices rallying.As we look at yields right now, the two-year yield this morning up a basis point for 27th 10-year yield right now. up just about two basis points, 4.04%.As I just had mentioned, Moderna falling after the company reducing its sales outlook for the year, expecting low uptake for the COVID shot in Europe.Biogen raising its profit outlook, cost cuts, faster sales of new drugs, boosting the second quarter earnings. And Meta, of course, after the close of regular trading yesterday, reporting better than expected sales for the second quarter.Also on the earnings call, Zuckerberg talked about Meta's push into the large language models that's going to power AI chatbots.Apple and Amazon, of course, report after the close of regular trading today.Dow futures right now up 29 points. S&P futures, they are 23 points higher.And the NASDAQ e-mini futures are 97 points higher.And we check the markets for you.Am I going too long?For you, all day long, right here on Bloomberg Radio.As long as we want to go, Lisa would have gone longer.Oh, would she have?She's so charming, we don't give her grief.You on the other end, see ya.She'll be back tomorrow.No, Monday.Pardon me. John Tucker, thank you so much.Greatly appreciate it.He was generous to be with us yesterday for a lengthy conversation, a too short visit today with Ethan Bronner in Tel Aviv.Ethan, I looked up, as someone ignorant, the size of Hamas, and I was thunderstruck to see the number 40,000.I don't know if that's accurate or not.It's a widely used number, yeah. With one death here, one death here, a death three weeks ago, how many Hamas leaders are out there for Israel to go after?That's a good question.I mean, the announcement today was done a couple of weeks ago, as you said.I think that really the situation is they need to get Yehoshua, the main leader right now.That would truly break the organization in a substantial way.Until that happens, it's hard to imagine. And I think that they can replace them, and they do.I think the Politburo is kind of built with the understanding that people get killed along the way.Ethan, what is the Israeli government, how are they positioning their efforts towards, again, prosecuting a very aggressive war against Hamas, while also trying to move towards some type of agreement where they can get the hostages back?I mean, I guess they have a dual track here, but what's the endgame?Yeah, I mean, there's a... right this minute but there's not going to be any negotiating going on right this minute what's happening is this country is bracing for an expected attack an almost certain attack of some kind in the coming days That Iran would be behind.It would probably come somewhere from Yemen, from the Houthis, and from Hezbollah or from Iraq and Syria and the militias there.So it's almost certain.I mean, and look, in April, the Iranians sent 300 missiles and drones here, and the Americans and the French helped the Israelis stop them. And it was both real and an act of theater.And that may be what we're going to see here, that it's a sort of an effort to show and not necessarily to start a real war.But who knows?To partition the sadness of this, is this about a dome defense of high technology or is this a defense against terrorism?Well. You know, that's the thing, actually, that has been illustrated since October 7th, that Israel's high-tech air defenses turned out to not be sufficient for guys who have store-bought drones and who dig tunnels and so on.So it turns out that Israel needs to adjust its defense doctrine, and it's in the process of doing so, including by building a larger army. Ethan Bronner, thank you so much.Too short a visit, but exceptionally busy in Tel Aviv, our news bureau in Tel Aviv with the leadership of Ethan Bronner.This is a joy because if you're in Chicago, there's a rite of passage.It's 134 pages long.It's from the 20s, and you can't apply even if you don't read Frank Knight, Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. Joining us on 90 and Uncertainty and what we witnessed yesterday, Anna Wong joins us, driving all of economics.I got eight questions on unemployment, your incredibly nationally recognized discussion of birth-death model and that.But I want to talk about ambiguity within risk and uncertainty.What's the unknown unknown you heard yesterday in that press conference? I think the unknown, unknown between now and then is will the stock market pull back that we saw for a couple of days last week?Will it turn into something bigger, which could lead to uncertainty fix?You sound like Greenspan.Are you telling me that monetary economists are running policy off of the stock market? Well, you heard Powell that the first part of the FOMC briefing is actually on the financial conditions of the economy.So yesterday what Powell did is that we'll see that yields are rallying, so that should loosen financial conditions.But between now and September and even now to November, we're thinking about whether there will be a second rate cut. is whether the loosening in financial conditions would translate into higher core PCE inflation.We saw last December that the moment that Powell pivoted the market rally, and then in January and February, inflation data was surprised on the upside.And that component, you can track it back to the stock market component.So this is why going back to the stock, what will the stock market do?Random walk?Or is it with a drift?Or is it going to continue climbing the stock market? Did you see her work in institutional sales at Smith & Barney a couple years ago?Yeah, it's a random walk.It's drift.She'll be thrown out of the room.She can do anything she wants.So, Anna, I mean, there are a lot of folks out there, including a guest we're going to have coming up later who's also Chicago-trained, that feels like the Fed is already behind the curve, that inflation, if you look at the real-time data, it's tame.This economy is really slowing on the margins, and they're too late here.How do you – Think about that.Yeah, I would agree on the whole that the Fed is late because the Fed has a dual mandate.But if the Fed only has an inflation target, then I don't think the Fed is late.And I think the reason why is it's very interesting.Tom, you love history.So if you look at 200 years of inflation data, whenever an inflation shock happened at the end of two year, whatever the inflation is settled at is about the end of that disinflation process.It's a I think it's a It's not just a statistical regularity, as they would say, but there's some mechanism driving it, which is that usually the base effects goes away, whatever.So the x-axis on disinflation is two, three years, right?Yes.Okay.Where are we in that continuum right now?We are at the end of that.So whatever I think the core PCE inflation is at at the end of this year is basically what the underlying is. I got to go back in the time we've got left.Victory lap, folks, for Bloomberg Economics.Anna Wong, I'm serious here, folks.I make jokes about it.I mean, you should see her.She named her dog Microeconomics.What's that about?Dr. Wong, you set the tone nationwide for the discussion of the birth-death model, and you suggest our job numbers are over-optimistic.How much down do you bring non-farm payrolls when you adjust? I think when you smooth over an entire year, currently the birth-death model is overstating on farm payroll by about $400,000.Wow.Over the year.For this year.Divided by 10, even I can do that.$40,000.So it's $30,000, $40,000 per month.Yes. So what do we expect to see tomorrow in the labor market?I mean, do you feel like the labor market is still solid, or should we be concerned about a 4.1%?Yeah, so tomorrow's number will be very tricky because over the reference period, we had the Hurricane Beryl, which if it follows the similarity of Hurricane Irma, from 20, I think it's at 17, then it should knock off about 30 to 40,000 nonfarm payrolls from the nonfarm payrolls.But at the same time, I think, based on everything we see, without Barrow, I think nonfarm payroll would be over 200,000 as well.What's it like being in a class with Krasner? I mean, he's such a beast mathematically.Did you, like, have to take Intro Math 101 to survive Randall Kroszner?I didn't take Randall Kroszner, but everybody in Chicago is mathematical, and everybody had to do a math camp, a summer math camp.You do a math camp?Yes, before you start.So you're top flight undergraduate, top flight masters, whatever, and you go.Paul, did you go to math camp?No, intensive math camp.I'm afraid.Eight weeks of intensive.Eight weeks?Yes. With a slide rule?With a slide rule.That's what we used to use back when I was with Frank Knight and Milton, what's his name?What do you do at Math Cap at a PhD level?You review all the, you know, calculus, real analysis, statistical, you know, math metrics.Now let's go, can we go nerdy here?We got Clarida coming in the eighth hour.So Clarida Gertler, Gertler Clarida.You take dynamic stochastic general equilibrium theory, DSGE. Basically, it's a straight line, folks, with a smooth curve that only Bernanke understands.Do you walk through the mathematics of DSGE in MathCamp?That would be a little too early.We're just young chickens in MathCamp.But yeah, we do walk through it in the first year immediately.You jump right into it.Right into DSGE.And do you hate Clarida when you do that? Claire is actually quite a mathematical person.The way he talks is very precise, I think, in his mind.He's thinking mathematically about... Do you want to come back in the 8 o'clock hour so you can ask the vice chairman some questions if you may?I... Yeah, sure.Can you in the 8 o'clock hour come back?Yeah.Talk to Rich.Can we do that?Yeah, absolutely.I mean, it'd be like a Columbia Chicago moment.You've got to be good.He's a former public official.We can't treat him like we treat you.His nephew used to intern for me.Clarita's nephew interned for you?Yes.Really?Did he go to Columbia?No, at the Council of Economic Advisers in White House.Oh, this is a White House job.Wow. It all comes together, Tom.Anna Wong, thank you so much.And congrats for all of us at Bloomberg Surveillance, Team Surveillance.Congratulations for moving the debate nationally on our labor economy.Anna Wong driving Bloomberg Economics.And we hope she'll join us here in the next hour with the former vice chairman of the Fed. Forget about that.Apple this afternoon.That's what matters.How many iPhones are they selling here?That's really the question.That's all it's about, how many iPhones are they selling.Why would anyone buy an iPhone in this quarter?Well, I'm buying one in September.I need a new one.Oh, no, but that's what they're going to say in the conference.See you in September.Stay with us.No singing forward.Good morning. Whatever happened to Tony Horton, the guy who created the revolutionary P90X?2017, I was knocked down.A very rare type of shingles that went straight into my brain.My body was completely wasting away.I started researching everything related to building my muscle back again.That's when I learned about the potential of HMB plus vitamin D3 and what they can do when it comes to helping build new muscles.So Tony developed high-impact protein by Power Life.

We have a spectacular show.We had the best-ever Fed program yesterday.Richard Clarida joining us in the 8 o'clock hour, the former vice chairman.We hope Dr. Wong can attend as well.Bill Dudley was with us yesterday.And what we saw were seismic moves, and within a mundane press conference, the most fascinating new territory for our central bank.I should point out Bank of England cutting rates here 15, 18 minutes ago. An extended conversation with Wei Li of BlackRock.Wei Li, let's just start with a why.Why do we see price up, yield down? Well, from the Fed meeting yesterday, I think September is pretty much a down deal.The bar for not cutting is very high.So I think that's what markets got excited.But importantly, the way that Jay Powell framed the reasons for September cut is also why markets are happy with yesterday's meeting.He characterized what's happening in labor market as normalization rather than labor market weakening.And what is going to lead to a September cut that is looking very likely is more around better behaving inflation rather than weaker labor markets.So I think that's a good combination for risk assets.On a y-axis, it's logarithmic.You end up looking at a curve as convexity.Is there literally a short cover In bonds now, is there literally an equity-like short cover where everybody goes, OMG, yields are going lower? Well, if you look at the hedge fund positioning, absolutely.A lot of the speculative positions went from short bonds to long bonds.But I would observe that front end of the curve has done better than the back end of the curve.So mainly in response to kind of markets pricing in more cuts.But our concern for the back end of the curve, especially over a longer term horizon, still stays, which is a higher fiscal trajectory, higher term premium, which currently is still in a negative territory.You've got a great note out here, your weekly note, Wei Li, and I'm looking at your assets in review.One of the best performers is gold here.What do you make of that? Well, I think if you look at what's been working so far this year as a diversifier is not your go-to good old duration in a portfolio, but rather some of the other assets such as gold.And on top of that, the negative correlation between gold and real rate has increased. helped there as well now having said that it's really hard to kind of think about gold in the context of a longer term portfolio construction simply because there's no cash flow to discount future cash flow with now having said that there is a case to be made to allocate to gold in portfolio because of the the the characteristics that it has exhibited as you observed as well So, you know, the central banks are certainly in focus yesterday with the Fed.Today with the Bank of England cutting interest rates, traders believe that there'll be another rate cut in November.What do you make of the Bank of England? Well, Bank of England is very interesting, right?So headline inflation is already at target, but coal inflation service inflation is still somewhat sticky.You can talk about some of the Taylor Swift effect and labor market wage as well.But broadly, we see better behaving inflation. And I think that's what gave the Bank of England comfort to cut rates.We think that there is more room for them to cut than the Fed because of a structurally weaker growth outlook, which is why we prefer guilds over treasuries.Right. We want you to come back for the next segment.I really want to focus on Asia and China with your immense skill and heritage there.But I got to ask the question.You stumbled into it.And I hope that your badge works at BlackRock this morning.You mentioned gold without cash flows.That reminds me of Bitcoin.Is Bitcoin developing as a gold equivalent? Well, what we have seen is that it has the ability to demonstrate a huge price appreciation, but also depreciation.So basically a lot of volatility.So I think a case can be made, a tactical case can be made for Bitcoin from a speculative kind of perspective, not unlike venture capital. capital type of investment.But again, it's really hard to think about kind of the longer term allocation because there's no future cash flow.There's no future cash flows.I don't know how she gets lunch at BlackRock with that because they're like me first into the ETS.I bust in your chops, Whaley.I'm sorry.Whaley, what's the character of this bull market?We have the rebound.NVIDIA has gone from a 104 to a 123.Is this an AI celebration? Or let's not forget the AI nervousness that characterized the few trading days before yesterday's meaningful rebound.So I think what we're experiencing right now is the cold feet that we're now used to before tech companies reporting earnings.This is the sixth quarter of chat GPT era.And every quarter they come in, they beat and markets kind of get reassured. Similar to April, markets got nervous, and then the earnings were okay, and then we continued to go from strength to strength.I think this is what we're seeing right now.NVIDIA is not reporting until end of August, so I think there is still a lot of anxiety, but excitement as well.Can the 10-year yield go under 4%, and how does our world change with a 398 10-year yield? Well, I think 4%, 398, these are psychologically important levels, but we're talking about not far from where we are, right?So given how volatile rates have been, I think it's possible that it can break 4%, especially given the repricing momentum.But I think the big picture here is important, which is number one, Rates have been very volatile.Markets have been swinging from one narrative to the other narrative in very quick succession.So I think expect volatility.And number two, once we look through that volatility, we're still talking about higher than pre-pandemic rate levels because of structurally inflationary forces.Let's not forget that. Let's come back.Wei Li with us with BlackRock.Generous to be with us for a half hour.We will really focus there on China and what we see there in economic growth, but a number of other topics as well.Paul, an extraordinary show.In the next hour, the former vice chairman of the Fed. and get a sense of kind of where he sees this Federal Reserve.Again, as Wade Lee was mentioning, market pricing in, you know, pretty solid rate cut beginning in September.He was forceful in his defense of Jerome Powell yesterday.Futures up 26.NASDAQ up six-tenths of a percent.VIX hasn't moved 16.20.From New York City, Bloomberg Surveillance.

John Tucker, thanks so much.With us, Wei Li of BlackRock, and of course, with all of her heritage from China, her ability to win their most prestigious mathematics event two years in a row, extraordinary.We're thrilled she could join us today.Wei Li, in 2015, I walked down the stairs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and there in a phenomenal show, China Through the Looking Glass, was one of the few extant 1960s Chinese military uniforms.I guess they're extremely rare.And it was from a China from another time and place.There's talk that President Xi wants to take elements of the Mao past and drag it forward.Do you see that in any way I guess they're extremely rare.And it was from a China from another time and place.There's talk that President Xi wants to take elements of the Mao past and drag it forward.Do you see that in any way that after the plenum, China wants to revert to a 60s or dare I say a 50s model? Tom, it doesn't take a math Olympian to see that growth in China is slowing down, right?You look at the latest Caixin PMI print that decreased versus the previous print following disappointing Q2 growth number.To your point, Plannan came and went, State Council came and went, and Politburo came and went, and they all paint a similar picture. which is that they would support growth in a kind of bite-sized fashion, including surprise rate cuts.But we're not talking about big bazooka, right?So, yes, we're looking at maybe around 5% growth for this year, which is their target.But there is a huge amount of focus around medium-term reform, and that is a trade-off. median-term progress versus the near-term growth, which is why we have a neutral allocation despite the appealing valuation opportunities in China.From where you sit and the experts at BlackRock, I just don't want to put this on you, but do you see them going back to the standard formula of state enterprises as being the solution, manufacturing, industrial production, or can they actually jumpstart and make permanent a consumer revolution? Well, consumer savings rate is one of the reasons why they need to support near-term growth, because coming out of the pandemic, consumers have not really boosted growth the way that U.S.consumers have and European consumers have.And this is really in the context of high youth unemployment rate, in the context of aging population. in the context of still lingering deflationary fears.So consumers are not really kind of picking up the baton, so to speak.And we have seen manufacturing side of things having to do more heavy lifting.So indeed, I think we need to really kind of think about how far consumers can support the economy.And this is also why over the longer term, we're looking at Chinese growth with a three-handle by the end of the decade because of the structural habits I just talked about. So it seems like their policy here of isolating themselves, whether it's from a technology perspective or just an overall economic perspective, whether it be in the context of U.S.tariffs, European tariffs, I just don't see how the Chinese government feels like that is a viable long-term strategy.It would seem like they would want to integrate with the global economy, not isolate themselves.Is that part of your neutral call? This is actually one of our mega forces that BlackRock has identified, geopolitical fragmentation.Isolationist policies are possible not just in China, but you look at what's happening globally, you look at what could happen in the US as well.And this is why we're looking at an environment where spheres of influences are moving further apart. fragmentation of supply chains, creating inflationary pressure.This is also why, even though we have had the last quarter of inflation better behaving, downside surprises, we think inflation is likely going to actually settle at a higher level compared to before because of frictions coming from isolationism, coming from the fragmentation of the supply chain, duplication of supply chain.So really, inflation-protecting portfolios is what we're thinking about for strategic asset allocation.Again, Whaley, and not to pin it just on you, but the greatest thinkers at BlackRock globally, and I know you've got a huge Asian presence.You just set a three handle on a run rate of China growth, I believe.What does that do to Vietnam?Frankly, what does that do to Japan?That's an entirely new Asian regime, isn't it? Well, what we have seen is whilst the exports from China to the U.S.has decreased, the exports from Mexico, for example, to the U.S.have overtaken that from China.So I think there is a restructuring of supply chain and trade relationships that is happening.It takes time, but it is happening.So likes of Vietnam you talked about, but India, and also Middle East and Mexico for that matter are likely going to benefit as we think about this fragmentation of the geopolitical relationships and fragmentation of supply chains, but elevating on a higher level.So that's one of the mega forces.Other mega forces like aging population also benefit these countries that I just talked about.So really think about international diversification as we think about portfolio construction in the context of everything that we just touched.Wei Li, I see in the BlackRock research, you guys are overweight in Japan.And that's something I haven't heard in a long time. Yes, we have been overweight in Japan for quite a long time.Now we prefer Japanese equities over JGB, Japanese government bonds.What we have seen this week is Bank of Japan indicating that they are likely going to move faster on the path of normalization.And this is important because the destination hasn't changed.It's the speed of normalization that seems to be faster.But my most important takeaway from the BOJ this week is that The backstop is still in place.If data does not give them comfort to move fast, they would slow down.So that's important as we think about the Japan call.But certainly risks have increased because of the faster pace of normalization.I would know, though, U.S.dollar, Japanese average is just 1% lower compared to the peak.So we like Japan on a currency-hatched basis for that reason. This has been wonderful.Wei Li, thank you so much, particularly in the comments on China.We have to go now to a huge story for journalism in America.The Moscow Times in the last 16 hours says Russia may free 20 to 30 political prisoners in historic exchange with West.That has occurred.Bloomberg reports that Wall Street Journal reporter has been released by Russia in a multi-country prisoner swap process. Roz Matheson, driving all of our government reporting, joins us now.Roz, a number of weeks ago, the reporter from the Journal found guilty, and that sets up the prisoner swap.Were we surprised how rapidly this occurred?A little bit surprised by how rapidly it occurred, but also surprised, I guess, by the size of what is happening.What we know so far, as you said, is that Evan Yerskovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, has been freed. as has the former U.S.Marine Paul Whelan, of course, who's been sitting in jail since 2018 and convicted on spying charges that he denies.So we know those two are part of the package.We know there's a multi-multi-person swap negotiated over months, you'd have to imagine, because it involves a bunch of countries, a bunch of people on either side.Big questions, of course, about who Russia is getting in return for all of this, for releasing Evan Yurkovich. and Paul Whelan.So this is obviously something that's been carefully negotiated over a many period of months, but they obviously were anticipating, of course, that Evan Yurkovich was going to be found guilty and was going to be jailed in Russia. Do you understand within your reporting and with Henry Winter's leadership in Moscow, do you understand, Roz Matheson, that this is a strategy by Russia to go around and pick up Westerners for whatever reason, including Evan with the Wall Street Journal, so that they can get back more valuable espionage-like people in a prisoner swap? Well, we've seen this as a pattern, yeah, because we had the WNBA star, Brittany Gruner, who was put in jail for nine months on a fairly minor thing involving cannabis oil.And she was used as leverage there. really, for Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to get the arms dealer picked about back.So this is obviously a pattern where they can use, you know, fairly ordinary US citizens, you know, sports stars, reporters, but use those as leverage to get some quite serious characters back in return.And again, the real question here also in, you know, the important news that Evan Yuskovich and Paul Whelan shared had been freed, is who's going back the other way?Roz, is there any notable aspects as to the timing?Why did this happen now?Well, it sounds like it has, again, been going on for months.So this is not something that just started a couple of weeks ago, but with the view, no doubt, that Evan Yerskovich was likely to end up facing a long prison term.And so I guess also the U.S.administration is keen to to get this sorted before Joe Biden's administration ends its term at the end of the year.They've been pressing hard on this, though, for many months.And a key character on the Russian side, of course, has been in frame for quite some time, and that's Vadim Krasikov, who's sitting in a German jail for the 2019 killing of a Chechen separatist in a Berlin park.And Putin has said publicly many, many times he wants Krasikov back, and Germany had said no because he's convicted of a crime in Germany and so perhaps this is just a moment where all the stars aligned in terms of Putin getting what he wants out of it.Again, we don't know exactly who's going back the other way and for the US to get Evan Yuskovic and Paul Whelan in return. There are plenty of other names in the mix, it seems.We don't know, again, a lot of the details, but we know this is a multi-multi-person as well.If you're just joining us across the nation in worldwide Bloomberg surveillance this morning, an exceptionally busy August 1st, our Jennifer Jacobs reports that U.S.reporter Evan Gerskovich of The Wall Street Journal and former U.S.Marine Paul Whelan They have been in a prisoner swap, and as Roz Matheson says, of a far larger size than was expected a week or two ago.It's a very short story, but a very powerful story for both sides.Paul Sweeney, why don't you continue with Roz? So, Roz, again, how does this come about here?Is this driven by the White House?Is this driven by the State Department?Who kind of leads these discussions, which, again, don't seem to be one-offs.They seem to be, as you mentioned, part of the pattern here.Well, they are driven to some extent by the State Department, but also at the very highest level.And this is actually one area where, despite Russia's war in Ukraine and the broader tensions with Russia, that we've seen – there'd be a little bit of a room to discuss prisoner swaps, both the Ukraine and Russia, but also Russia and the US.This is one avenue, one conduit, one discussion point that has remained open throughout.And we have seen some of those prisoner swaps occur already in recent years, as mentioned most notably with Brittany Grana.But it's clear that this is something where Putin feels that he has something to gain. And he only negotiates when he feels he has something to gain.And so that's why these doors have remained open.But You can imagine there has been like months and months of very careful and delicate and tricky negotiations that have gone on, largely involving the State Department, but also other aspects of the U.S.administration to get this over the line.Ros Matheson, thank you so much from London, driving all of our government coverage.Joining us now from the Taubman Center, Brown University, Wendy Schiller, not on the American election, but on a prisoner swap. Wendy Schiller, there's a various and sundry Tom Hanks movie where there's a bridge, I'll say, in East Germany.I can't remember where.And there's a prisoner swap of one person for another.Or it's a John le Carre novel.You know the drill.This is not like this. This seems to be an organized effort by Russia to grab a reporter with no espionage past or Paul Whalen, a Marine who went over to Russia to go to a wedding and picking him up.Is this just Putin and the Russians using us to affect a prisoner swap for their valued espionage material? Well, I mean, yes.I mean, I think, Tom, that's a good instinct.But it's also a signal to journalism, right?A signal internally to Russia.They've always cracked down.We see all countries all over the world doing the same thing.And it's a message not only to internal Russian journalists, but international journalists.You know, don't come into my sandbox.Don't give me negative reporting.I'm going to shut the doors on that.And he did, and he arrested him and held him.And thankfully now he'll be released, or he's already been released, But this is just a signal that says, you know, I'm going to do what I want to do in my country.And if you are going to try to report on it, I'm going to shut the door on you.Wendy, what will the Biden administration do with this news here?Will they take credit for it?Will they just stay on the sidelines?How do you think they're going to play it? I think that if Biden were still running, he would make an argument that engagement and diplomacy and conversation, even with people who are perceived to be our enemies, is always important in the world order.That's an argument he would have made and he would have had 50 years to back that up. Does Kamala Harris take that on?Probably not right now.It's not been her theme.But it certainly credits the idea of engagement when Donald Trump's position and his party's position veers towards isolationism.So the argument is if you stop talking to people, then you can't get anything done in the wrong order. Wendy, with all that's gone on here, the center tendency for Americans has been a journalist and a Marine at a wedding over in Russia.From where you sit with decades of experience, is it safe for anyone to travel to Russia? Yeah, I mean, I think that the United States has to really rethink its warning policies.They are pretty proactive about it.But, I mean, you could make the same argument even to go to many parts of the world that we thought we could go to, like Venezuela or Israel.Right now, the world is in great turmoil. you can argue that nations or individual actors and outside actors act with impunity against Americans in a way that you could say maybe 30, 40 years ago they did not.And that's where Donald Trump comes in to argue that if he's president, they're going to stop doing that, that he's going to instill fear in those actors, and the Americans will be better protected.So it's kind of a double-edged theme that Donald Trump is trying to sell the American people about how he'd be president.And I think Kamala Harris is going to have to address these sorts of issues as she continues in her campaign. What does this say about Mr. Putin here?Is this just part of his toolbox of international diplomacy, a little bit of a terror edge to it? Well, you know, politics is all about uncertainty, and I'm going to leave it to your excellent Russia reporters and experts here.But, you know, it used to be two weeks ago that maybe Trump was going to win, and he was going to win relatively easily.Now, we don't know who's going to win the American election, and Putin, no matter what he does, still has to deal with President of the United States.So in this sense, he's had to do the best. Right.So he doesn't want to risk being completely demonized, shut out, having any negotiating power with Kamala Harris, let's say.And this is just something that just happened.So I don't think it's coincidental that it culminated now.And also you see in Ukraine, there's a sort of a weakening that, you know, keep going and going and going.And maybe there's some sort of peace that can be established.But Russia will walk away from territory.So it was pretty good timing on the part of Putin right now. Wendy, thank you so much.On short notice, from Brown University, Wendy Schiller here.Again, Jennifer Jacobs reporting for Bloomberg that Russia is releasing Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former U.S.Marine Paul Whelan.And this is, again, a major prisoner swap.The Moscow Times had this 18 hours ago as being 20 and even 30 people.We'll have much more detail on that.Certainly something. that we will follow through the day here at Bloomberg.And thank you, Rosalind Matheson, for joining us, driving all of our economic coverage scheduled.And we have a good amount of time here right now. is Jumana Birtashi.We are thrilled that she's in Dubai, driving all of our Middle Eastern coverage with the leadership of Horizon and her program there, but far more the spirit of speaking to people across the Middle East.And we speak now with Jumana about her Lebanon and about what we see in Israel and such. Jamana, first of all, to your many, many contacts in Lebanon, the tension north of Israel right now, the tension in Lebanon, give us a description of that. It's difficult to describe.I guess my sigh speaks for itself.But overall, tension is possibly the highest it has been in the last couple of decades.This is an extremely fraught moment for the Middle East, given the events over the last couple of days and the various fronts that are opening up, not just within Gaza, but of course, now you have a new potential active front in Lebanon after the Beirut strike that took out the right-hand man of the Hezbollah leader a couple of days ago.You have a potentially new front opening up in Iran after the airstrike in Tehran the same night as the Beirut airstrike.And then, of course, you have the ongoing Houthi attacks on the vessels.Let's not forget about those as well.So you've got multidimensional hotspots opening up around the region.And there is serious concern that there is a potential slippage, one miscalculation, could have this thing really blow up and end up in a scenario where all sides end up regretting.On your reporting on Horizon, as you speak to Emirati leadership, and for that matter, Arab leadership of the Levant, who are they supporting?Who are they focused on here among the various parties? It's interesting you raise that, Tom, because it's very nuanced depending on which country you speak to in the region.Now, don't forget that many of the Gulf countries actually did sign an Abraham Accords, a normalization agreement with Israel back in 2020 that includes the UAE, that includes Bahrain, and also includes Morocco as well.So they've been... treading very carefully on the subject of the war in Gaza.Of course, Saudi Arabia as well have been playing a very fine line diplomatically because as we've been reporting over the last few months, they have been working very closely on a normalization deal that would coincide with the defense deal with the U.S.as well.So they don't want to give up on that.But what the Saudis told us is that essentially they can't push forward with the normalization deal while there are still boots on the ground in Gaza. Other countries, you look at the likes of Egypt and Qatar.Well, their role throughout all of this has been to play the role of the mediator to push forward these ceasefire discussions.And I thought it was really telling yesterday that the prime minister of Qatar, who also serves as their foreign minister, put out a tweet right after the killing of Ismail Haniyeh saying that it is very difficult to push forward with these negotiations if one of the sides of the negotiators has been assassinated.So I think there's a lot of pessimism now about the future of these ceasefire talks. And Germano, you mentioned some of the countries, Egypt, Qatar, that are trying to act as mediators.But it appears at this point that Israel has had no interest in pursuing peace at this moment, even thinking about their relations with the U.S.Is that a concern in your part of the world? It's definitely a concern.I think there are many analysts out there who are questioning the full faith of the Israeli government to actually engage in these ceasefire discussions.We know that there have been several, many diplomatic attempts to push forward with the discussions, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been in Asia this past week, and he gave some comments in Malaysia overnight saying the path that the region is on is towards more conflict.It has to make the right choices in the day ahead because those choices are the difference between staying on this path of violence, of insecurity, of suffering, or moving on to something very different and much better.So the U.S.are still trying very hard to push forward with these discussions. Germany, other countries looking to get involved as well.And the feedback from the Qataris is even though they're pessimistic, they still want to push on.But the question, the other question is, who is going to be representing Hamas?Because two of the most senior figures have been eliminated in the last two days. Jamon, I've got one minute left, and I just want to take advantage of your encyclopedic knowledge of Lebanon.I get out a map like an ugly American, and I'm shocked that Haifa is 60, 70 miles from Beirut.The distances, folks, are so short.How far do you perceive that Israel would move north across the Lebanese border?Is it one or two miles like Syria and Turkey, or do they move into the suburbs of Beirut? So the short answer is there was a war in 2006, the Lebanon 2006, a July war.And on the back of that, it was a very costly war for both sides.A resolution was put in place called Resolution 1701, which dictated that Hezbollah has to move about 30 kilometers away from the southern border north of the Litani River and give up its arms.Obviously, the resolution hasn't been implemented, but The analysts within the community will say Israel is not going to stop until 1701 is implemented.And even the prime minister, the Lebanese prime minister, is saying it's time for 1701 to be implemented.So they just want to push back Hezbollah.Do you see how Jumana does that?She stays in kilometers.We're nationwide in America. I think my math is the American hack is 18 miles is what we were translating.They're lost in translations.Thank you so much, particularly for those comments on your Lebanon.She, of course, delivers horizon each and every day. in Dubai.Quiet morning, Paul.Oh, geez.Yeah, exactly right.So, yeah, news coming across fast and furious.And again, the market's looking a little bit higher here.We had that strong trade off of the Fed meeting yesterday in the Fed press conference.I think most of the market kind of said, all right, this Federal Reserve is really trying to position itself for a September rate cut.And that's what we saw in the market action yesterday.Got a little bit of green on the screen here this morning, Tom. The markets are there and the tech earnings are there.Again, the Bloomberg article and the headlines from Bloomberg.It was interesting to see the Journal pick those up.Thank you to the Wall Street Journal as they have stayed on this story for well in excess of a year.Unbelievable.Front page every day.Jennifer Jacobs reporting.Evan Gershkowitz and Paul Whelan released by Russia in multi-country prisoner swap.We'll have that balance of power, of course.We'll focus on that.Joe Matthew and Kayleigh Lyons here later today.

And among those that were swapped were Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former U.S.Marine Paul Whelan.There may be others.We've been told this is a big swap, but details are still forthcoming on that.Greg, Tom's been kind of asking the question here this morning.I'll follow up.Is this becoming a strategy of Mr. Vladimir Putin in terms of picking random Westerners off the streets in Russia and then swapping them for valuable assets in the West? Well, certainly there have been those that have accused him of just that, and certain Western officials have levied that criticism.It's very clear that there have been an uptick in arrests of Americans, and we've seen over the past couple years some high-profile swaps.So that accusation has been leveled.Moscow has denied it.But clearly, we expect that there will be Russians released.There have been Russians that Putin has eyed and has almost very clearly indicated that he would like to see relief.So it does appear to be somewhat of a strategy on his part.So, Greg, in the world of global journalism, how do you and your Western counterparts cover Russia?Well, it's certainly gotten difficult not being on the ground. But there still are ways to do it.It is an increasingly hard country to cover, and as we've seen, a dangerous country to cover, with Evan Gershkovich being a case in point.U.S.officials have determined that he was wrongly detained.His newspaper has said that he was just doing his job in journalism. when he was arrested.So it is a dangerous and complex country to cover.But there are ways, and we keep trying.Greg from Dubai.Greg Sullivan, thank you so much.Greatly appreciate it.And again, we'll revisit this through the morning.We're trying to track down David Gurra right now with his abilities as well. This is a joy, and it goes way back, and it was wonderful yesterday to talk to Richard Clarida and put him in an incredibly uncomfortable position.We had the senator from Massachusetts talking about the unfairness of Richard Clarida's central bank.And, of course, I asked him about the Gilded Age, and we went back 120 years, and he sidestepped it in the best green Spanian fashion I could ever see.For some reason, Richard Clarida comes back for more this morning.Thank you so much for joining Bloomberg this morning. As always, thanks for having me.What changed yesterday?The fact, and I understand there's some geopolitical yield going on there as well, but we had fixed income up, yield down, equities to the moon.What was the Fed signaling that gave markets confidence? I think a couple things.First of all, one could argue that, if anything, the FOMC statement itself maybe was a little bit less dovish than folks might have thought.But yet again, the press conference, I think a fair reading of the press conference was that it skewed a bit dovish.Now, again, the move in prices was quite small.The September cut was fully priced in before the meeting.It's fully priced in after the meeting.But this is a committee that cares about both sides of the dual market. mandate.They've made that clear now in the statement.And they also made clear they're getting increasing confidence that inflation's on a path to two.And finally, that they actually discussed at the meeting yesterday, cutting rates at the meeting yesterday.So all in, I think that's what the markets were reacting to, Tom. Richard, there are folks in academia and in practice in the marketplace that feel like the Fed is already behind the curve, that the real-time data suggests that the economy really is slowing.And by the time they get cutting rates, it may be too late.How do you respond to that? Well, good question, because I think that is a risk they have been willing to take for a couple of years.Indeed, Chair Powell made that very clear at Jackson Hole in 2022.As inflation has moved towards target from above, they've increasingly and yesterday in the statement indicated that they now are looking at both sides of the dual mandate. That said, I agree with them.I think the data coming in are certainly consistent with an economy operating at or perhaps a bit above trend.So I don't think they're in a danger zone here of falling behind the curve.Moreover, they've made very clear that if they do see any softening in the labor market, it looks like they won't hesitate to start cutting.So there's risk management here, I agree, but I think they're in a good place. You want to sell this.You know, you got to get some PR, Richard.Basically, Richard Clarida made modern Columbia economics.He took the heritage of a guy named Stiglitz, a heritage of a guy named Phelps.There was some guy doing fancy math at Princeton.He said, come on up to Columbia.And what's amazing about this is you even teach microeconomics at Columbia still. Like Pierre-Andre Chapori.I mean, you got microeconomics.Well, how does microeconomics fit in at Columbia, unlike the madness at Chicago?Well, I work in some micro in my classes.I think it's best for all concerned that I stick to the macro.You also mentioned Bob Mundell, who passed away not too long ago, a dear friend and colleague.So at one point, I think we had four Nobel laureates on the faculty.So, yeah. Let's bring in our Nobel laureate Anna Wong with a question for the former Vice Chairman Anna Wong of Chicago and Bloomberg economics. Yeah, Rich, you mentioned that this committee is one that's very focused on both sides of the mandate.And do you think that going forward, you know, suppose that we do have the Trump number two administration with what's happening with the potentially higher tariffs, would that factor in into the committee's September meeting deliberations or even November deliberations?Should they do preemptive deliberations? Should we just leave the studio right now, Paul?Exactly.That was a totally unfair question, Rich.Well, first of all, Ann, as you know, I'm a big, big fan of your work, so keep up the good work.I think Jay Powell made it very clear yesterday.He got a couple of questions. And he said, look, we're going to base policy on achieving our mandate.I think he mentioned he'd been at the Fed for now four presidential election cycles.So I don't think it will be a factor.And I'm actually glad they clarified that because there had been some meme in the markets that the pal fed might hold off doing anything to see how the election turned out.And that and I think clearly he set that aside.And this was really something his voice changed. I'm sorry.This happens like Mankiw when he was at the White House.He'd get upset, and all of a sudden he'd go into Harvard lecture form when he got upset.Bernanke used to do the same thing.Anna, ask another question to make us look puny, please.Yeah, I want to push... On that point, a little bit, Rich, you were there during the Trump first trade war, as was I. You were briefed about the inflationary impact of the first trade war, and you probably remember that the briefing was tilting toward saying that the tariffs were inflationary, which didn't turn out to be.And right now the mainstream economists, Wall Street economists, are uniformly saying that it will be very inflationary again.What's your thought on that? Well, there are a couple of things.First, if anything, during my time at the Fed before the pandemic, inflation is running a little bit low.The main thing that emerged at that point in 2019 was that the trade war, concerns about the trade war were very negative on economic activity and sentiment. I do think the details will be important.I think that, in particular, there would be an inclination, depending on how they're structured, if there were tariffs, to try to distinguish between if it's moving up the price level, like a value-added tax, whereas it's inflationary. But I think the key thing for your listeners to bear in mind is that's a decision the PALFED does not have to make now.They made it very clear.2024 rate decisions are based on 2024 data and outlook.They'll have plenty of time to reassess and think about this as they go into 2025.So good question, but I don't think it will be a factor now.You defended William McChesney Martin.Paul, one more question in this section with Rich Clarity. All right, let's assume the Fed starts cutting in September.Then what?How do they prosecute this policy to get rates down?Is it every other meeting?How does that work? Well, the trite answer is it's data dependent, but I think they've acknowledged that if they cut once, they will be thinking there's more than one cut.We'll get good information on that in the projections.We'll get another set of projections in December.Here's what I think.I think there are basically a couple scenarios.One is a very, very soft landing, you know, in the spirit of the Olympics, sticking the soft landing in. In that case, the economy just chugs along a trend, unemployment doesn't go up, inflation moves gradually down to two, and then they can gradually cut rates as inflation falls.In other scenarios, the economy slows more sharply, and then I think they can cut more rapidly.I do think the bar right now is pretty high to hike rates, and so I think if the economy gets stuck at inflation at current levels, they may not cut very many times and keep rates at an elevated level. But importantly, it could depend on the outcome of the election.But again, we won't know how that plays out until 2025.Richard Clarida, please stay with us.We've got so much to talk about.I'm going to look it up right now.You can do this on the Bloomberg Professional Service, the FOMC meetings.Paul, there it is, January 29th after the inauguration. That'll be the meeting.That'll be the meeting.Put that on your calendar, Dr. Clarida.We're going to have you back there January 29.Anna Wong, thank you so much for joining us with Bloomberg Economics.Important questions.Tough questions on politics.Bring it.We can't answer weird questions.It was Chicago against Harvard there.That's kind of what I was saying.It's different.There's a different oxygen out there. We can talk to Rich.We'll come back and talk to Rich Claret about Knightian uncertainty.He knows I'm death on Bayesian dynamics.Oh, who isn't?I mean, you know, we'll have to see.There's huge news flow today.We've been remiss.There are technology earnings this afternoon.We had markets green in the screen now, red and green in the screen as well.But we have exceptional political news this morning.Our Jennifer Jacobs reporting within the hour. that we see a prisoner swap of the United States and allies with Russia.And we'll get much more on that.That news is really coming off a single State Department directive, and we'll have much more on this coming up.And this involves two key Americans.Futures up 22 from New York City with Rich Clarida, Bloomberg Surveillance.

Markets, headlines, and breaking news 24 hours a day on Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg Television, and the Bloomberg Business App.This is a Bloomberg Business Flash. And I'm John Tucker in the Bloomberg Newsroom. A little later this morning, in less than 15 minutes, we're going to get a read on jobless claims.July's unemployment print.Tomorrow, that's going to provide further clues of the state of the U.S.labor market.Meta Platforms, among the most actively traded this morning.Sales beating, adding the sales beat there, adding fuel to the rebound for tech companies.For the technology stocks, investors are going to be watching also earnings from Amazon after the close for further clues about the market. returns from investments on AI.And then that report from Apple will give indications of how the iPhone 16 is expected to perform in September.Dow futures right now, they've just turned higher, up seven points.S&P E-mini futures up 25.The Nasdaq futures right now, 102 points higher.The twos and tens are both three basis points higher.The 10-year at 4.06%, two-year at 4.29%.And we check the markets for you all day long right here on Bloomberg Radio.I'm John Tucker.That's your Bloomberg Business Flash.Paul and Tom.John Tucker, thanks so much.The Olympics are occurring, and they are magnificent.The Summer Games are updates.Our Summer Games updates, they're brought to you by State Street. global advisors.It has been a blur of a morning.Thank you for joining us across the nation on YouTube, Apple CarPlay, on Android Auto.What a joy to have Anna Wong with us from Chicago and Bloomberg Economics, and we continue with the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve System, Richard Clarida, this morning.Richard, you and I could turn this into a three-hour love fest.We don't have the time to do that, so I'm just going to cut to the chase.I was busting Anna Wong's chops about Frank Knight 1921, 134 pages.It's a rite of passage.And it's where we really began to think in the modern era of the unknown unknowns, the idea of what's the mystery that's out there.We have a pandemic overlay we're coming out of.We have an immigration dynamic we don't understand on the edge of Angus Deaton. There's too many mysteries.Productivity is a mystery we have.What is Richard Claret as unknown unknown if you were to sit down with the chairman this morning? Well, those three would certainly be on the list.I think an additional unknown is the global fiscal outlook is terrible.You know, 20 years ago, debt to GDP ratio was 40%.It's north of 100%. Now, debt service costs exceed the defense budget in the U.S.And so everyone acknowledges that global fiscal paths are unsustainable, but there's no political will.So I think the known unknown is when and what brings about the ultimate adjustment in fiscal policy, because it will happen eventually.I don't know if it's next year or in 10 years, but I think to me that's the known unknown. You know, I'm of a certain vintage.I've heard that my entire life.We've had this little clock down in lower Manhattan that ticks up the den.I remember that as a kid driving up the east side. When, where will we see that, the concerns about global debt?So, excellent point, because why has it fallen, why have the bond market vigilantes been in hibernation?Some would say they're extinct.And the simplest answer is because global interest rates have fallen by more than debt has gone up.So until recently, it seemed like a free lunch to politicians.Borrow, but your debt service costs go down because interest rates are falling.And so, The point is, going forward, interest rates are not going to be as low as they were in the prior 20 years.And so the cost of that debt service will be more evident.And so at some point, that will drive a political outcome.But I do agree with you.The can has been kicked down the road for a long time, and it may be a while.But to me, that's a known unknown.And what is the fix, ultimately, from an economic point of view? It depends on the country, but if your deficits are too large and your debt service costs are too high, there's going to be some combination of adjustments on revenues and adjustments on outlays.But neither party is running on a platform to address that, and so I think it will not really be an issue in the campaign.Wei Li was with us last hour, stunning us with a potential three-handle on China GDP growth. I want to go to a guy named Stiglitz, who way back at Stanford started to think about the little g of the growth rate.Olivier Blanchard and Stiglitz have really focused on the fact the global little g growth rate is better than good to sustain our fiscal policy.Do you suggest that we could see a diminished global growth rate that finally upsets the apple cart? It could be growth or it could happen through the interest rate channel.Remember, Olivier's famous equation is it's about R minus G. And so if G falls or R goes up.Can you figure can you call Stockholm after the show and say, can we get a shingle out for Blanchard on R minus G?Give it to Williams as well.OK, exactly. So what do we do when we have too small a G on our minus G?Well, exactly.And so if you have too small a G, then it brings forward the day of reckoning on fiscal adjustment.I'll just leave it at that.Okay.He's being careful.But this is real because Italy, with their demographics, it was like over, done, small G's done.And with the revolution of their politics, they've got actually very good G because you're spending money in that little quarter in Venice buying lots. Little G Matters in Italy.How about in China, though?I mean, how big of a concern is that for the global economy?Because I'll look at just something like their population.I mean, it's aging, and it's aging at a much higher rate than a lot of other populations.I don't see that changing.So what does that mean for global growth? Well, obviously, China's global growth has been slowing.We all remember when the number was seven or eight, then it was five or six, and now it's four or five.So it's a very big economy.So four and a half percent growth in China is still a big part of the global outlook.I think the real difference, though, compared to the past 20 years is the way in which the Chinese economy interacts with the rest of the global economy, commodity prices, activity. You know, I think everyone agrees the big era of hyper-globalization is over.And so the way in which Chinese growth drives the rest of the economy, I think, is changing.And it's actually something we're looking at closely at PIMCO.We mentioned this yesterday.I busted your chops, Lawrence Meyer.Paulie wrote a little small book about the Greenspan Fed, where it was Alan Greenspan and everybody follow. I'm sorry.Hugh Pill, Jonathan Haskell, Megan Greene, and there's that troublemaker, Catherine Mann, dissenting at DOE.But remember, Hugh Pill is the chief economist.He went against the governor.Why can't your Fed be as normal and human as Catherine Mann's Bank of England? Well, I will say that the Bank of England, certainly beginning with my good friend and mentor, Mervyn King, 30 plus years ago, it was a point of pride that their culture did not discourage dissents.And indeed, I think there was one or two meetings when Mervyn was outvoted. In this case, it was five to four.But when the chief economist votes, it definitely gets the headline.Sure, there are dissents at the Fed.During my time, we had several meetings where there were three dissents.But it is the case that in the post-Green Spanian era that you refer to, or Greenspan and then post-Greenspan, dissents among governors have been pretty rare on monetary policy.And that's an entire other show we could, I won't spend time talking about why that is.You can come back tomorrow.Okay, well, okay.Rich Clarida, thank you so much.For John Farrell, Lisa Brannwitz, and myself yesterday, the fair decides for Paul Sweeney and all.This has just been very generous of you at this key time for our monetary policy.What are they going to do at the next meeting? They're going to cut rates.There you go.There you go.That's all we need.We'll leave it there, Eric.Be sure that gets on that single best idea.Rich Clarida of PIMCO, of Columbia, and of our Fed, thank you so much.Futures up 30.Green.Clarida lifted the market.We had running greens.Single-handedly lifted the market.Paul, NASDAQ up six-tenths of a percent. Exactly.We're going to get some more tech earnings after the close here, Tom, Amazon and Apple.So we'll see how they're going to position their companies and their stories and their strategies around this AI play.I'd like to see more dissent.I'm sure Professor Clear would disagree with me, but I think the way the Bank of England does it is great.I just think it's a better way.The 10-year yield... 4.03%.Wow.We have economic data.Please stay with us.Thank you, Commonwealth, for your support there.Worldwide, this is Bloomberg Surveillance.

Fed-fueled stock and bond rally.The futures again pointing to a higher cash open.Dow futures up 70.S&P mini futures are 32 points higher.And the Nasdaq futures up 118 points.And the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment, 249,000 for the week ended July 27th.That is higher than the previous reading.Also, higher than estimated, economists surveyed by Bloomberg.So some signs of a weaker labor market moving forward.Meta reporting better than expended sales for the second quarter, among the most actively traded in the pre-market.On the call, Mark Zuckerberg talking about Meta's push into large language models that will power AI chatbots.The two-year yield right now, one basis point lower now, 424%.

Yeah, absolutely.And again, just on the initial jobless claims, 249,000. Close to 250 claims increase and unit labor costs decrease.Also, the revision, which leads you to that dampening feel.Yeah, absolutely.And again, just on the initial jobs claims, 249,000 consensus was 236,000.Remember, last period was 235,000, a little bit of a tick up. There.So we're keeping an eye on that.But let's go right to our next guest, Tom Robsak and global economist with Citi.I know those people.388 Greenwich Street, home of the worst elevators on Wall Street.Talk to us about what you heard from your Federal Reserve yesterday.Yeah, absolutely.I think with the Fed, you know, the statement didn't have as much changes as we were expecting or I think many were expecting.But then Chair Powell came out and I think was pretty clear that the Fed's getting ready to ease rates in September. message.The second message is they are getting a little bit more concerned about that second leg of the mandate.They see the upside risks of inflation have diminished, but some of the downside risks on the activity side have increased.And so I think that's going to be important for guiding policy going forward.It's not just about inflation anymore, both sides of the mandate.Are you concerned that the Fed is maybe too late in kind of cutting rates? I don't think so.I think it's interesting.They have been cautious in their holding pattern, maybe even more so than some of these other central banks where you've seen cuts already.But at the same time, the U.S.economy has been very resilient, so they've had less need to cut.I do think you're getting to that point where both sides of the mandate do argue they should cut rates given the improvement on inflation and the downside risk in the labor market.So I'd be very surprised if they didn't cut in September.Right. Rob Salkin, we made an upgrade here.We had Clare in the chair you were in here moments ago.We went to Citigroup.And, of course, what Willem Bauder built with Catherine Mann in the omnibus, the holistic sense of Citigroup economics, goes to a question I asked the vice chairman moments ago.And it's on the Bloomberg screen right now.I got a productivity lift. I got unit labor costs revised in new number in, and there's this overlay of productivity in America.How does Citigroup treat that when you try to interpret our future? Yeah, absolutely.And that's the big debate right now.You know, the productivity numbers have been a lot better over the last year, but it's coming off a period of much weaker productivity.And so the question is, are we moving just back to that pre pandemic trend?Or are we moving to a higher stage of productivity growth?If it's the latter, That's a good argument for how you get a soft landing, and that might be what we're seeing in the labor market.You're seeing wage growth come down as productivity has been higher, but it's a huge debate, and it's very hard to judge these things in real time.Right now, we're skeptical that productivity is durably higher going forward, but that is a real debate, and that could be what's happening and what's driving some of these soft landing narratives. Where's Holland Horse after the meeting yesterday?Did you guys make a momentous change?You want to break some news here?No, it's the same spot.Every meeting, rate up.Every meeting.And that's really based on that sharp slowdown in the economy that they have.And if you don't get that, I still think you get a few cuts from the Fed this year.But then next year comes to be a bigger question.They'll probably move much slower and more cautiously if you don't get that big slowdown.But right now, same call, cutting at every meeting based on that slowdown. I don't know.It feels like a soft landing to me and the John Tuckers of the world.I mean, is that in fact what the Fed has achieved here, do you think?You know, right now, that's the way the data are feeling.And I think you heard that from the Fed.I think they feel, too, that they've gotten that soft landing, even though, as I mentioned, they're more concerned about the downside risks. And right now, there's a lot of noise in the data.We're seeing that with jobless claims.Maybe that's a sign things are worsening.But Q2 GDP came in well above expectations.Saw some pickup in some of the PMIs.So far, it's still feeling pretty good.But things can turn quickly, is what our U.S.team would argue.Link it with the Citigroup platform. Paul and I are standing here.I'm looking, Paul, off that economic data.I wanted to see a 399 print on the 10-year.I don't have that.4.02, which is still, oh, wow.I got a real yield of 1.79%, out of range finally.Oh, wow.And I got equities.Scott Cronin's going, yeah, I can retire.Oh, wow. What is going on in our audience is saying, OK, wait a minute.America's flat on its back.There's all these anecdotes out on Twitter of half the country's unemployed.And yet I got, oh, wow, statistics.Why?Yeah.I mean, as you said, there's all these anecdotes, stories about things slowing down.And there's some if you look at some of the data, you could argue that that's where things are heading.But for the most part, the economy has been enormously resilient. and inflation has continued to improve.And I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the data.I mean, 2.8% on GDP in Q2, a consumer that keeps spending.Confidence is very low if you look at consumer confidence surveys, but you don't see that reflected in the hard data.And as I said, we're seeing improvements in inflation.The last few months of inflation have been very good, and wage growth is falling.So I think that's what you're seeing reflected.The data are looking a lot better than the anecdotes. Neil Dutta, publishing moments ago, he's so snarky.I mean, Dutta's nailed it so well in the optimism coming out of the pandemic.Paul Sweeney, he goes, oops.And basically within a longer paragraph, thank you, Neil Dutta, for sending this in.In my view, the upshot is this is a small policy mistake that can be undone very quickly.So I guess I've got to actually pay attention to the Fed minutes and the Fed speeches.I never do.No, I let Mike McKee do it.But there it is.Yeah, exactly.Thank you.All right, so... What do you make – we were just talking to Richard Clarida about the global debt, the U.S.debt, deficits.How do you guys think about that stuff?I mean at some point it's going to matter, but again, I'm of an age when I say I've heard this my whole life.That means something.Yeah.I don't know.It's a real challenge.I mean if you look, we have a nice table, kind of a heat map that looks at vulnerability across major governments. in terms of things like debt servicing, debt levels.And the U.S.ranks as the most worrying across all of those metrics on average.But you're not really seeing that reflected in markets.You saw a little bit of that last year.People were really getting concerned.You've seen blips of it this year.But so far, markets have been willing to absorb that debt.And so until that stops, I think you're going to see bigger deficits and bigger debt going forward. Rob Salkin, thank you for the brief.We had a huge economics morning.It's wonderful to have you finish it out for us.Mr. Salkin is with Citigroup as well.Futures up 31.Yields move off the economic data.Claims elevated.With our news in New York City, John Tucker. All right, Paul and Tom, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gerskovich has been released by Russia in a multi-country prisoner swap.Swap also includes Marine veteran Paul Whelan.The man jailed in Russia on espionage charges, and the U.S.denies that.They're en route to destinations outside of Russia.According to people familiar with the situation, the U.S.and its allies will return prisoners to Russia that they hold under the deal. Professor Wendy Schiller, director of the Alfred Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy at Brown University, spoke to Bloomberg about it. I think that, you know, if Biden were still running, he would make an argument that engagement and diplomacy and conversation, even with people who are perceived to be our enemies, is always important in the world order.That's an argument he would have made and he would have had, you know, 50 years to back that up.Does Kamala Harris take that on?Probably not right now.It's not been her theme, but certainly credits the idea of engagement when Donald Trump's position and his party's position veers towards isolationism. That's Wendy Schiller with Brown University.The Israeli military saying today it's confirmed that the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammad Def, was killed in an airstrike in Gaza back in July.The announcement coming a day after an apparent Israeli strike in the Iranian capital killed Hamas's top political leader. And there's backlash over Donald Trump's comments about his potential opponent in the presidential race at the NABJ.The former president saying Vice President Kamala Harris did not identify as black until recently.It got contentious when Trump said Harris would address the convention by teleconference while he claimed he was not given that option. I was told my opponent was going to be here.It turned out my opponent isn't here.You invited me under false pretense.And then you said you can't do it with Zoom.Well, you know, where's Zoom?She's going to do it with Zoom and she's not coming. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania Governor John Shapiro met with Harris' representatives as the Democratic candidate has to pick a running mate soon.The Paris Games, overall medal count, the U.S., 31, France, 26, China has 21 medals, Global News, 24 hours a day, and whatever you want it with Bloomberg News Now.I'm John Tucker, and this is Bloomberg.Paul and Tom. It has been an extraordinary news flow.My head's been spinning.I've had almost no sleep off of the Fed show yesterday.Thank you to our team for putting it together.Best show ever we've done.And, Paul, can we just digress to something not about economics, finance investment, or jazz chism?Can we just do something?Here's the fact.John, help me out here. I'm spending $79 a month on YouTube TV.I got an $8 overlay of Peacock so that, you know, Vet Bill can watch the Olympics.Now, Hannah Miller's reporting that the Disney-Fox-Warner Brothers Sports Combine, they're going to take $42.99 a month?Yep.Your reaction to—this is 1985— This is another step in the way to just streaming everything, effectively, and particularly sports.So it's going to have, as you mentioned, Tom, Disney, which gets you some ESPN stuff, Fox, Warner Brothers Discovery.So you get some NFL stuff, some NBA stuff. What's notable is what's not there.CBS is not there.Oh, they have NFL as well.The whole NBC, which gets you all the Universal stuff, that's not part of it.So, again, it's up to you and all consumers to figure out what they want to pay for and how they want to pay for it.Man, it was so much easier back in the day with a cable. Will the streaming, what's it called?Venue.Venue.Well, that really works.V-E-N-U.Yep.Will venue sports allow me, like MLB, to watch three National Football League games at the same time?I don't know.We don't know.I don't know.But it's going to, this is just one step into where we're going to get to where everything is effectively streamed and nothing of value will be on broadcasting cable. But it's getting us out to $300 a month.Tucker, are you spending $300 a month at home?The rabbit ears, free.The rabbit ears are working.Reruns of The Andy Griffith Show, free. It depends what you want.Exactly.But they have to look at sports, Tom.I mean, that guy, this got your attention because it's sports, you know.And what's the price, $42.99?I have no idea because there are prices out there.That's $43 a month for those.Exactly, from $10 to $100 a month.There we go.That's the first pricing of the sports thing.Yeah, there you go. We will see.We'll continue to monitor.It'll pop up in your credit card statement.Oh, yes, it will.Also, my three Netflix subscriptions.I don't know where that came up.Markets lift.Futures up 25.NASDAQ up four-tenths of a percent.Across the nation, Bloomberg surveillance.

I'm John Tucker and it's your Bloomberg Business Flash.Paul and Tom.John Tucker, thanks so much.I want to give you a vignette, folks, into how we operate at Bloomberg Surveillance.With the heritage of Matt Winkler and John Micklethwaite, we are fact-based.Jennifer Jacobs is leading our coverage here on this prisoner swap.The initial two or three paragraphs of Ms.Jacobs was very curt. very straightforward, almost like a State Department release.And, Paul, that's the way it stayed.You go to the Wall Street Journal website, which I went to two minutes ago, and the story's really not out there yet.No, it's not.And I think this is important across the nation to understand this is breaking.To give you one vignette, And this is the Telegraph in London, and they've got key moments, they call it.And beginning at 3 a.m.this morning, Russian jail moves, mystery prompts hopes.Then 20 to 30 prisoners is the idea.That was a surprise, according to our Roz Matheson.And then there's further dripping of news out.But I don't have... a major story on this yet.It is very, may I state, Paul, and editorialize it, it reads like a movie.It does.And I think we've seen that movie before.For what it's worth, again, the cable networks are starting to carry this story at the moment.But you're right, Tom, it is absolutely breaking.Joining us now, Wendy Schiller with the history of this, of course, at Brown University in the Tubman Center.Wendy, I think I said to you an hour or two ago, I can't remember You know, a Tom Hanks movie and a prisoner swap.But as I see the names leaking out, speculation of who these names are, what is the difference between the prisoners America and the allies are getting versus the prisoners that Russia's getting? Well, the only thing we can interpret right now with the knowledge we have is that Putin values the release of these prisoners, either for domestic reasons.It could be internal politics within his own government.He wants to show, A, that he can still be a partner with other nations in reasonable negotiations in his mind. And you can say that people were unduly detained in Russia, the American hostages in particular.But nonetheless, he is portraying the image of somebody that people can work with. And I don't think the timing is accidental.I think it has it's an adjustment to what's going on in the American political scene right now at the presidential level.It's also, you know, I think it reflects a little bit of the stalemate in Ukraine.OK, I'm going to go there because you went there, Professor Schiller.Are you suggesting that this was sped up because of the advent of Vice President Harris into our presidential race? I think that Putin recognizes he wants to be in the mix with whoever wins this election.And he doesn't really gain from being demonized by the Democrats.Biden certainly being what we call old school in terms of sort of a Cold War and a product of the Cold War. was doing quite a bit of that.I don't think Harris will focus as much on that.And certainly Trump doesn't do it at all.So Putin wants to end up somewhere in the middle of that intellectual framing on what kind of partner he can be and what role he plays in the world. Tom, we have a red headline across the Bloomberg terminal.Correct.Wall Street Journal reporter to be released by Russia in prisoner swap.So, again, as you highlighted, Tom, this is a fluid situation.It's a fluid situation.I really want to emphasize this.We believe at Bloomberg.We don't do rumor.We don't do speculation.But we're going to aggregate in legitimate news sources.And we're doing that right now with the leadership of our Jennifer Jacobs at Bloomberg News.Incredibly fluid situation. All right, let's move on.Wendy, we're right smack in the middle of this very contentious presidential election race.The next issue, I guess, for VP Harris is to pick a vice presidential candidate.What's the latest on that? Well, we've heard that the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, I believe, is meeting or talking.You reported that to her team.If I had to guess, it's down to Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro.It's easier to take a senator out of a state.Arizona has a law that says the governor has to replace senators. a senator with the same party person.So the Democrats don't lose a seat and a special election or general election won't be held for two more years for that seat.So the Democrats actually are okay if Kelly leaves Arizona.But Pennsylvania is, I think, a little trickier to estimate.Is Josh Mueller stronger for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania as governor with the machine that he's built to win the governorship two years ago?Or is he better on the ticket to bring Pennsylvania, but also other states like Pennsylvania? And I think he's also an observant Jewish person.He has made that part of his persona.It has resonated not only with Jewish community, but also with religious people of different religious backgrounds.He talks about his faith a lot.So whether that's good for Harris or not, we're not sure.I have never written a song about this, but I'm going to go there, Professor Schiller.1960, my mother took me out to see Richard Nixon with a three-day beard. wool, Republicans, cigars.And there were a beautiful spring morning with JFK in a lovely blue silk suit and Mrs. Kennedy next to him.And guess what?The entire uproar where I lived was, OMG, he's Catholic.And to speak to you in Providence and Brown University folks, I hate to say that was a huge deal then. with great respect when the show are we going to have a huge deal of it's a harris shapiro ticket and i think that's a factor i mean nobody should put their head in the sand and say you know uh... someone who's a woman of color and uh... jewish canadian and the government was jewish ram with gore uh... good point out thank you right you know so we've had that before and and you are not only right about nineteen sixty but certainly the primaries a very few primaries that they had the democrats before that he would have been made an issue of JFK's Catholicism.So, you know, it wasn't just an issue in America.It was an issue in the Democratic Party at that time.So, yes, I think, and also, let's not forget Israel-Gaza and the disaffected younger voters and also people in Michigan of Palestinian Arab descent.You know, how will that play?Josh Perot is a strong about support of Israel. You know, if you have to weigh who's going to bring you votes, who's going to lose your votes, you know, if you have to think about neutrality, I think Mark Kelly is a more neutral choice than Josh Shapiro.And Josh Shapiro himself may be thinking of running in 28 if he wins re-election in 26.So very complicated calculation.Yeah, OK.I've got to be quick here.Paul Sweeney, how many times have you seen Top Gun?Oh, too many to count.Come on.How many?A dozen?Oh, 40, 50.Professor Shuler, how many times have you seen Top Gun? I've seen Top Gun a lot, and also Top Gun Maverick I think actually might be better than Top Gun.Okay, you're telling me the vice president's going to turn down Top Gun from Arizona?I'm saying that I think it's a more neutral and I think a slightly safer choice for lots of different reasons to pick Mark Kelly over Josh Perkins. This has been wonderful.Professor Schiller, you're such a trooper.What a hugely valued.Her civics textbook is definitive, and we're thrilled to have her on to give you a historical perspective of these moments as well.Should we quote the market now?Let's quote the market.Would that be good to do?We can do that. We can do that.We're 30 minutes away from a market opening as we do international relations and economics.That's all we're doing.Future's up 29.Paul Sweeney, the NASDAQ.I mean, Tucker, do you understand Sweeney's rocking a 601K after what NVIDIA's doing?Why is he still here? We just love people here.Please don't leave.NASDAQ up four-tenths of one percent.That's kind of a strong suit here today.On the yields, Tom, we've got the 10-year treasury worth 4.02 percent, pretty much unchanged on the day.But we've got to call out gold again, another hike, just under $2,500 per ounce on gold.And we're talking to Wei Li from BlackRock.That's been the best-performing asset. We'll have to see.We're going to come back with more from Bloomberg News on a prisoner swap.It's August 1st.Taylor Swift told me.Never have I ever before.But I can see it's lost in the memory.August lived away for too long in time.Cause it was never mine.

You know, there's not one type.There are six types of income to choose from in retirement.Reliable or unreliable, insured or uninsured, and exhaustible or inexhaustible.If forced to choose three of those six with the identical income starting next week, Which three would you pick?I've found that close to 100% of retirees would choose reliable, insured, inexhaustible income.I've also found that women especially really do find annuities attractive and appealing.Once they learn that the income is guaranteed for life in the range of 5% to 12% annually and that the insurance company does not keep your money when you die, women favor annuities for part of their financial plan.It makes them feel better. In the IQ Wealth Smarter Bucketing System, we believe that the main thing is to keep the main thing, the main thing.And the main thing is that a financial plan built on reliable, insured, and inexhaustible income is the most sensible first step in your plan for retirement.Think about it.If you have all the income you ever need, exceeding all of your living and lifestyle expenses from now on, no matter what, and you know that it is contractually guaranteed and backed by regulated audited reserves, well, wouldn't you feel better about the next 20, 30, or 40 years of retirement?Annuities offer the same benefit as well-funded pensions with regard to income.It is reliable, it is insured, and it is inexhaustible. Check the record.No one has ever lost a penny or missed one single income payment with any of the carefully selected insurance companies I work with.And many of these companies have track records going back 100 years or more. Each of them are legal reserve companies, meaning that if every annuity owner wanted all their money back all on the same day, each company must have the assets to pay, period.That capability is audited for each company by all 50 states.So if you or your spouse are somewhat risk-averse, The certainties and guarantees of an insured, low-cost, next-generation annuity can turn your retirement into a no-so plan rather than a hope-so plan with more income than you can spend.Imagine that.The right annuity can help you build wealth because the amount of income is so high from the annuity.You can dedicate fewer dollars to it and more dollars to growth vehicles of your choice.Every dollar you don't spend on fixed income, you can put in your pocket. You retire only once, but retirement strategist Steve Jurich and his team at IQ Wealth Management help people retire every day.Whether you're retiring early, late, or on time, you want a plan that is clear, easy to understand, and within IRS rules.You want truly effective strategies based on common sense solutions that are proven, designed by an experienced fiduciary with your best interest in mind.

When it comes to talking about all things relating to money, nobody does it like the Valley Leader for 25 years.Tell your friends about us.We're Money Radio at 1510 AM and 105.3 FM.Sandra Smith.I'm Charles Payne, and this is the Fox News Rundown. Thursday, August 1st, 2024.I'm Jessica Rosenthal.It is a tight race right now.Will it last?Will someone pull ahead?Or are we in for a nail-biter through November?They're getting excited about Kamala Harris, and he's got to find a way to make clear to swing voters who are still up for grabs that while she may be better than Biden when it comes to mental acuity and physical stamina, she's as bad as he was on the issues.I'm Dave Anthony. You don't hear this often these days.Most Republicans and Democrats agree on something.A plan to regulate social media.It is really the first time since 1998 that Congress has done anything that would protect children in the virtual space.We speak with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn.And I'm Charlie Hurt.I've got the final word on the Fox News Rundown. Fox News swing state polling shows a dead even race between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.She's not yet officially the nominee, though.She's campaigning and buying ads like she is.But we are not going back.At his rallies, former President Trump focuses on a number of perceived weaknesses, including how the vice president fulfilled her role given to her by President Biden to figure out the root causes of mass immigration to the country.He told Fox's Laura Ingraham in an exclusive interview this week. And she was for defund the police, she was for open borders, she was for having anybody come in.Now I notice that they're actually saying they want to have immunity for everybody that came into the country, and they want to have citizenship.Harris told a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday that it was Republicans who blocked the bipartisan border bill.Former President Trump had called it a bad bill and said blame him if it fails.As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law. and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.Wednesday, the former president answered questions posed by three black female reporters, including Fox's own Harris Faulkner, at the National Association of Black Journalists.One of the other reporters brought up past comments he'd made to black people and asked why he should have their support.He said the question was incredibly rude. I think it's disgraceful that I came here in good spirit.I love the black population of this country.I've done so much for the black population of this country.He was also asked to defend his vice presidential pick, Ohio Senator J.D.Vance, for his comments, including ones from 2021, about not letting Democrats win so the future of the country isn't in the hands of childless cat ladies. My interpretation, you'll have to ask him, actually, but my interpretation is he's strongly family oriented.But that doesn't mean if you don't have a family, there's something wrong with it.But he also questioned whether Vice President Harris was black, saying for years he thought we were told she was Indian.Her father was Jamaican.Her mother was Indian. You stay away from it.I mean, she is of Indian American and Black descent, and don't get into it.You've got plenty of other things that matter to swing voters than to engage in speculation about when she began to identify as Black and when did she previously identify as Indian American.I think he's absolutely wrong on what he's suggesting, but even if he were right, it's a waste of time.Carl Rove is a Fox News contributor. It is more important for him to stay focused on the things that will attract undecided and swing voters.And those are the things about her record, what she has said and done that affects the lives of ordinary Americans.Here's a woman who was part and parcel of an administration that lit the fire of inflation and drove up the cost of living for every single American.Inflation was rising at less than 2% a year when Donald Trump left office and then rose up to 8% and today is nearly 4%. And here's a woman who was charged by the administration with solving the root causes of illegal immigration, and illegal immigration exploded on the watch of the Biden-Harris administration.This is a woman who was part and parcel of a weak foreign policy that invited our adversaries to take on our friends and neighbors. And so better to spend his time on the things that really matter to voters because he doesn't have a heck of a lot of time left to convince those people.When President Biden withdrew from the race, gave a lot of despondent Democrats a chance to get excited, and they're getting excited about Kamala Harris.And he's got to find a way to make clear to swing voters who are still up for grabs that while she may be better than Biden when it comes to mental acuity and physical stamina, she's as bad as he was on the issues. You know, one of the things that came up on stage at the NABJ, and it's come up in recent days, as you know, is Ohio Senator J.D.Vance, as the vice presidential pick, some of the comments he's made, yes, about abortion, but more importantly about this cat lady's comment that the Democratic Party, if they are in charge, is essentially... leaving the future of the country in the hands of childless cat ladies.This was a point of contention also at the NABJ.I'm just wondering, the former president's response on Wednesday was, look, J.D.'s a family guy.He's like, you're going to have to ask him for more clarity, but he really believes in family.Does Trump need to do more on this, or does J.D.need to do more on this? Both of them do.And Trump sort of gave an invitation to Senator Vance to sort of soften the edges of this.And instead, he hardened him when he went on with Megyn Kelly.Look, if you are a woman who says, you know what, I just haven't been able to find time in my as I sought a professional career to have children or worse, women who don't who cannot conceive. And his basic thrust is you're not as worthwhile or as worthy a person as somebody who has children.I mean, you know, look, it's one thing to herald families.It's one thing to say we want to encourage strong families in America because a growing, dynamic American population – is good for our country and good for our economy.And stable families are part and parcel with stable, peaceful communities.And we want that.It's one thing to say that.It's another thing to start condemning people who may be childless for reasons beyond their control.And that's what that comment about, you know, childless cat people meant.Now, look, I'm a dog.So I get that.I get that. Dog thing.But rather than picking the negative side, pick the positive side.I mean, you know, if asked, I'm not going to attack cats, but I am going to advance dogs and figure that out, too.Don't don't cast a gate or or cast dispersions on women who don't have children.Herald strong families. And say, we want to encourage everyone who chooses to have a family, we want to make it easier for them to have a family and raise a family and provide for their families by having a strong, prosperous economy that's welcoming and open. Yeah, I mean, it's a perfect opening to discuss the declining rate of Americans having children and why that is and what you can do to address it.But, Carl, we see the rallies, we see the momentum, we see the memes.Most importantly, we probably see the polling.And I'm just wondering, what do you make of how Vice President Harris went from polling below President Biden to surging in this way.I haven't heard any analysts sort of explain.People like to say like, oh, the media just, you know, is on her side suddenly.But what is it?Well, that helped.But look, the main thing was a sense of relief.Do you think Democrats were blind to what we all saw as a country in that first presidential debate? Do you think that young people and blacks and Hispanics and Asian-Americans and the so-called coalition of the ascendant that propelled Barack Obama to office, that they were blind to the mental acuity and physical stamina of President Biden?And do you think they didn't see the decline?Yes, they did.And so one of the things that explains why people are enthusiastic today was the Democrats were so depressed about what they had before July 21st.As soon as he got out of the race, She wisely stepped forward quickly, got everybody in the camp.But she benefits most of all from the, you know, from Democrats who were who were despondent about their chances, given the circumstances surrounding President Biden.They're enthusiastic that they got a candidate who can string together two sentences and has got some energy and seems to be with it.Not some 81 year old guy who's going to be 82 by the time of the election. But the time of the inaugural got reelected.So it's not so it's not that by that Trump is doing so badly.It was Biden was doing so terrible that when you swapped him out, the normal enthusiasm of ordinary Democrats returned. Is what the Harris campaign doing now, is it smart?You know, she's now not against fracking.She's now not against health insurance.She is now for spending money on the border.Like, do swing state voters take her at her word then or now?Are campaign promises more binding than past positions?Well, you know, it really depends on how Trump handles it. First of all, look, she's done a lot of useful things for her candidacy.No ifs, ands, or buts about it.First, she grabbed the Biden campaign apparatus and made it her own.She grabbed it and staged the endorsement of party leaders in a powerful way.She had enormous success in fundraising because she wisely understood that Democrats given a new alternative would immediately begin to respond. And she took that grassroots enthusiasm and gave it a way to express itself.The idea of having Zooms where various groups would call together like minded people was brilliant.And she has also handled her vice presidential search and, you know, introducing us to a variety of people in a very short time frame.And she's done all of that well.And she is, as you say, started to shed some troublesome views.But. She can't get away from those views entirely.And she's got to be careful because, you know, she can't get rid.She can't sort of say too many things I've changed my mind on.Otherwise, people start doubting.I mean, they start thinking she's political about everything.The answer is to have for the Trump campaign to deliberately go after one thing at a time and pound away.And they've started to do this with this new ad, which I think is pretty effective, that attacks her on the border. But the key is going to be that ads enough are not going to be, you know, they're not going to be enough.They've got to back this up.Has she been running ads?No.She's been talking to the earned media and setting, you know, the newspapers and cable TV and network TV.They have to debate, right, Carl?They have to debate. Well, they have to debate.But in the run up to the debate, the Trump campaign has to frame her as a San Francisco radical and do so by substantive attacks on substantive issues and remind and remind people who she said she was and force her to say, well, I've changed my mind on that.You know, well, you know, when I said defunding the police or starting, you know, getting rid of ICE and starting it from the ground zero. No, I didn't really.You know, I've changed my mind.Get her to start saying she changed her mind on all these troublesome things.And people are going to people on the left are going to say, you know what?She isn't really with us.And ordinary people that are up for grabs in this election, the low propensity turnout and, you know, low information swing voters are going to say, wait a minute.She's changed her mind for politics.I can't trust her. Okay, lastly, Carl, it's already August.Early voting is six, seven weeks.That's very soon.If this is a honeymoon period, can it last all the way till early voting?In other words, is the timing here very much in her favor, moderately in her favor? Moderately in her favor.She's handled this initial period well.She's got to have a good rollout of her vice president.People have got to look at that person and say, good choice.That person could be president if something bad happened to her.I think her judgment is good.Her numbers rise.She's got to have a good convention. It can't be disrupted by huge mobs of people trying to invade the convention center over the issue of Gaza.If they do, she has got to turn it into a sister soldier moment.She has got to say, you know what, this is wrong.Israel has a right to exist.We can all be worried about the lives of innocent civilians, but what you are doing is standing up for a terrorist group that on October 7th murdered innocent people, raped and murdered innocent people, and today still has American citizens held as hostages in its tunnels.And she has to have a social moment.And then finally, it needs to have, in my opinion, she needs to be able to come out of that convention. Look, Labor Day is sort of the time when people start to lock in their opinions, and it's where we start making judgments about who's ahead and who's not.She needs to come rolling out of that convention, which starts on the 19th, runs the 20th, 21st, and 22nd of August.On the 23rd of August, she has got to come rolling out of that convention and have basically eight days of activity where people say, wow. where they say she's got big crowds, she has a message, she and her running mate are hitting their marks.I understand why it's important to elect her.And when I get to Labor Day, boy, I'm convinced.On the other hand, Donald Trump has the difficulty of, he also during that period of time has to raise big questions about her in the battleground states so that he limits how much a bounce or a bump she gets out of the convention.And so that this race is basically tied on Labor Day, and then he has to be prepared to have a good debate performance to regain the momentum.Between now and the time that her convention ends, it's going to be hard for him to have the dominance of the media like he has had thus far.Carl Rove, thank you so much for those insights.Appreciate it.Thank you.Appreciate it.All the best.

That's your Fox Business Report.I'm Kevin Uretzky.Invested in you.This is the Fox News Rundown. It's a very divided time in America, just months away from the presidential election.But the Senate just did something rare, approving something almost unanimously.The Senate keeps its promise to every parent who's lost a child because of the risks of social media.That's Majority Leader Chuck Schumer after a bill passed Tuesday by a 91 to 3 margin trying to make social media safer for children to use it. President Biden appears ready to sign the bill if the House also gives approval, saying in a statement, our children are subjected to a wild west online.It's past time to act. Lori Schatz's daughter Annalee committed suicide in 2020, and she tells Fox & Friends she didn't know till after.The dangers and the depth of addiction that these children can have and how powerful algorithms can change a child's mental health.Senator Marsha Blackburn's a co-sponsor of the Kids Online Safety Act that's paired with the Children and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act in the bill. It is really the first time since 1998 that Congress has done anything that would protect children in the virtual space.Senator Blackburn is a Republican from Tennessee.We have rules and laws that protect children in the physical space.You cannot sell alcohol or tobacco or pornography online. to someone who is underage.We as society have decided that kids that have to be 16 years old to drive and 18 years old to vote.But in the virtual space, children are exposed to alcohol, tobacco, pornography, sex traffickers, drug dealers, pedophiles, You see a lot of cyberbullying.You see sextortion.And we have worked for over three years to develop legislation that would put guardrails in the virtual space that would help protect children.There are 72 members of the Senate that are co-sponsors of this bill. And we have hundreds of organizations and thousands of parents and teams that have worked with us on this legislation.As I said, it's been three and a half years in the making.And what it will do is require social media platforms, all of these platforms like Instagram and Facebook and Snapchat and TikTok, to do safety by design, to have a duty of care, to open up their black box algorithms to have a toolbox for kids and parents so they can set the allowances that they want on the social media sites and help protect kids in that virtual space.It also will require these platforms to go through an annual audit to be certain that they're complying with the law.And it will require them to have a portal away for kids and parents to report bad actors and then require these platforms to remove those bad actors from their space.OK, so when they have a user who is under 17, They will now have to filter out content, be sure that some things are not seen by these users? What they're going to have to do is have that duty of care where they are not exposing children to these harmful, this content that causes self-harm, suicide, ideation, eating disorders, the cyberbullying that takes place. So putting in place those safeguards is something that, as I said, we have worked with parents, we've worked with pediatricians, with principals, with kids, and putting those guardrails in place and requiring these social media platforms to have that duty of care. Okay, now, cyberbullying in particular can sometimes be children who are bullying other children.I mean, is there a way they're supposed to know that that's happening, or is there something where a parent would complain to that platform that it's happening?Yes, indeed.That is the portal where they can report bad actors and report things that are happening.We've talked with parents, some whose children have been cyberbullied to death. and then they had reported this activity to the platform but the platform did not respond or it took them months and months to respond and when you talk with educators they will tell you that many times the problems that are the biggest part of the problems that are caused during the academic day for children are things that are perpetrated by cyberbullying that takes place in the virtual space.All right.Now, there have been parent parental controls on platforms already.What does this do to add to that? Yes.And the safety by design, thinking about what that exposure is.And, you know, if you were creating a product that was going to be sold in the marketplace, then the consumer protection agency is going to require certain safety guards on that product.We see this all the time. The problem that we were facing is this has never been done in the virtual space.The result of that is our children are the product when they are online because the data that the social media platforms have is really how they establish their wealth. They are valued by the number of eyeballs that they retain and the amount of time that they can hold those eyeballs.That endless scrolling, these algorithms that continue to feed things to kids and sends them down what they call the rabbit trail. kind of that cyber rabbit trail.And as a result, we have seen such issues, mental health issues with kids.We've seen an unprecedented amount of teen suicide and beginning to have that duty of care and that mechanism that can be reported and giving parents more tools where they can work with kids and set these parameters.That is just another way to help keep kids safe in this virtual space.All right, I want you to respond to some of the criticism.There are only three senators who voted against this.One of them, a Republican, Mike Lee.He complains that it ignores damage done to children by online pornographers, and he also believes it will censor content of viewpoints not favorable to the Federal Trade Commission. Your reaction?Yes.And he is mistaken in that this is not a censorship bill.It is not a content moderation bill.It is not a speech bill.And yes, he has a bill that deals with Pornography is a language in his bill was not something that could be added to this specific bill, but his bill is something that can be taken up at a later point in time. Okay.Senator Ron Wyden's a Democrat.He was worried that this bill could be used as a tool to sue services that provide privacy technology like encryption that he says would be essential to young people's ability to communicate securely and privately without being spied on by online predators. And this bill deals strictly with the social media platforms.It does not deal with websites.It does not deal with nonprofits.Okay.And so that, again, is a different issue. As far as you talked about it's not a censorship bill, the ACLU and others have complained that this could censor content, especially for, say, LGBTQ youth on certain sensitive issues.What do you respond to that?It is not a censorship bill.There is nothing in it that is a censorship bill.It is a product design bill. I want to ask you also about TikTok, since it is a social media app, certainly.The other day, the Justice Department alleged that employees were sending information about U.S.users to the social media company's parent Chinese company.Of course, Congress has passed a law forcing TikTok to separate itself from Chinese ownership or be banned in the U.S.next year.What do you make of TikTok and where we are with that? One of the things we've had concerns about TikTok, and we've raised this in hearings, is that their user data is not stored in the U.S.And the Chinese Communist Party has a board seat on TikTok's board.They are owned by ByteDance. And ByteDance is a Beijing, China company.Now, the way their corporate structure is, this information can be shared with the Chinese Communist Party.Now, after we found out it was not stored in the U.S.using servers in Texas, they called it Project Texas, they said, well, it was stored in Singapore. and then we found out no they actually have corporate governments that requires they share it with their corporate owners one of which by dance and by dance is in beijing to think of the fact that they are having access and they can build a virtual you of TikTok users.Because when TikTok is on your phone, it is such an invasive app.It follows not only your activity on TikTok, but it also contains spyware that looks at the activity that you have with other apps and utilizations on your phone. So you support the ban of TikTok as it is now?Yes, I do support banning TikTok from the U.S.marketplace.All right.Now, former President Trump, your Republican nominee in the presidential race, he's on TikTok and he doesn't support a ban.Have you had a chance to speak to him about that?And that's just where we have a difference of opinion. All right, quickly back to your Kids Online Safety Act.The House takes it up next when they return in September.Do you think this is going to be signed into law this year?Yes, I do think it's going to be signed into law this year.The parents that have worked with us on this have just been spectacular.They have really used their stories of grief with the loss of their children to push to get this legislation done. They have been very thoughtful.They have been insightful.They have shared their stories with so many offices and have said, this is not going to bring my child back, but it will help prevent another child from losing their life or taking their life or ruining their life because of meeting drug dealers or pedophiles.

Time for your Fox News commentary.Charlie Hurt.What's on your mind?Just two weeks since an assassin's bullet came within a fraction of an inch of killing former President Donald Trump during a speech on live national television, Google has already begun vanishing the story. Type in assassination attempt on T-R-U-M and Google's search engine directs you to Internet pages about an attempt by Puerto Rican nationalists to assassinate President Harry Truman in 1950.They never made it past the door.No wonder Google's corporate motto when it first launched had to be don't be evil. It remains a struggle for the company.Google's disdain for free speech and determination to undermine democracy is rivaled only by the dishonesty of the political media, whose fortunes today rely entirely on Google's whims.Together, the media and Google work feverishly to erase from public consciousness the attempt on Mr. Trump's life, lest it garner sympathy for him among voters before November's election and reveals him to be the bravest man in American politics today. These are some seriously sick and twisted people.It is no different from what the media have done since Mr. Trump arrived on the political scene.They spun crazy conspiracy theories about Mr. Trump and his family while lying to the public to prop up and protect any Trump political opponent who came along.Remember the silver-tongued porn lawyer Michael Avenatti?He was going to be the next president, according to CNN.But instead, he is serving time in federal prison for extortion, fraud, and embezzlement. As for Mr. Trump's near assassination, the American political media have strained to disappear the story.Even when forced to report the biggest news of the year, the New York Times cropped the photograph of Mr. Trump, blood gushing from his wound, being rushed off stage so that it would make Mr. Trump appear less brave and heroic.Google eventually retired the don't be evil slogan.The New York Times never had such an excuse. Amazingly, the best reporting to come out of the assassination attempt came from Gary O'Donohue, the North American correspondent for the BBC.Within an hour of the shooting, he aired an interview with a witness who said the gunman had been spotted on the roof well before the shooting, but authorities failed to do anything.In the most fitting irony of this moment in American political media, Mr. O'Donohue is blind. Not only was an actual blind man able to see the story that the entire American political press refuses to see, but he would have done a better job than the Secret Service at protecting Mr. Trump from getting shot in the first place.By the time the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee rolled around a few days after the assassination attempt, the media were in no mood to listen to Republicans or half of the American population who vote for Republicans. The whiny scolds at MSNBC boycotted the convention, but they did not want to miss an opportunity to lie to their viewers about the GOP convention.So they set up a fake background screen showing the floor of the convention and provided hours and hours of lies and fake analysis from their fake studio in New York.Again, I'm not making any of this up.Weird times indeed, but not weird in the way Democrats claim.I'm Charlie Hurt, opinion editor of Washington Times.

Now on Business for Breakfast, quick hits.These are the companies making headlines bright and early on this Thursday morning.We start with Hershey.Shares were down 7% in the pre-market after the chocolate maker posted second quarter results that missed analysts' expectations.The company earned $1.27 per share on revenue of $2.07 billion.Analysts over at LSEG expected $1.43 a share and revenue of $2.3 billion. Today's operating environment remains dynamic, with consumers pulling back on discretionary spending, according to CEO Michelle Buck.Amazon stock in the e-commerce giant was up about 2%.Second quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday.Analysts polled by FactSet forecasted earnings of $1.03 per share on $148.6 billion yesterday. in revenue.Etsy, the e-commerce stock, dipped 1% after posting mixed quarterly results.Etsy topped revenue expectations, but adjusted earnings came in at $0.41.They were expecting $0.45.Shake Shack shares were up about 9% in the pre-market after the burger restaurant chain posted its second quarter results.The company reported revenue of $316 million for the second quarter.The LSEG estimate was $314.Shake Shack also raised the lower end of its full year revenue guidance. Meta, Facebook, the tech giant stock, saw shares surge about 8% pre-market after the company beat second quarter estimates and issued a better-than-expected forecast for the current quarter.Facebook parent company's results point to continued share gains in the digital ad market, and that is the company's core business. Moderna shares tumbled 11 percent after the drugmaker cut its full year sales guidance before the bell.Moderna said it expects competition for respiratory vaccines in the U.S., lower sales in Europe and the potential for deferred international revenue.However, the company reported a revenue beat for the second quarter and narrower than expected loss per share. The chipmaker known as Arm Holdings slid more than 9% after disappointing earnings forecast for the fiscal second quarter.Arm expects adjusted earnings in the range of 23 to 27 cents.LSCG wanted 27 cents.That's what they predicted.Teladoc.Shares of the telehealth company pulled back 19% after second quarter revenue was about $8 million off of estimates.Teladoc also declined to provide its full year outlook.That's never a good thing.Ferrari. Shares in Ferrari were up 4% after the luxury sports vehicle company beat second quarter earnings and revenue estimates and raised its full year outlook.MGM Resorts, the casino operator, was down 3% despite posting second quarter results that beat expectations.MGM reported earnings of 86 cents per share on revenue of $4.3 billion.Analysts were expecting 62 cents on $4.2 billion.Well, why was it down so much?

Good morning.I'm good.How are you?I'm doing excellent.I appreciate your time very much.So you guys have this migration trend, kind of basically you find out where the U-Hauls are coming from when they come one way into Arizona, right?That's correct, yes.All right.Where are they coming from?I already know number one.That's easy.California, they're coming.I don't blame them.I'd get out to them.That's right.That's actually our top one, yes, California. Is it not even close, Whitney?Is one to two a big gap, you know what I mean, as far as the sheer numbers?It's a fairly large gap.I don't know the exact numbers, but yes, I mean... I mean, you can tell just being in Arizona looking at license plates as well.Yeah, no, definitely.My second guess, I've now looked at the list.My second guess was Illinois.It's on the list.It's not second, though.It's number 10.But we have so many people from Chicago that call Phoenix their now forever home or whatever for the time being home. So I think that I saw that coming.Some of the ones, I guess the rest are pretty much West Coast based, with the exception of maybe Florida's thrown in there, right? Correct, correct.Yeah, most of it is going to come from the West Coast.Yeah.All right, so let's go over the top 10, and then you can tell me some of the other stuff this kind of mid-year migration trend report tells us.So California 1, Texas 2, that makes sense, Colorado 3, Nevada 4, Washington State 5, New Mexico 6, Utah 7, Oregon 8, Florida, that's kind of the random one in there at 9, and then Illinois at number 10.Correct. All right.What else are we finding from this mid-year migration trend?You also look at where they land, too, right?Because they don't always just come into Metro Phoenix.No, they don't.You know, I would say a good large part do come into Metro Phoenix, being that Metro Phoenix is so large.But you're seeing some of the outskirts with, you know, Buckeye, Surprise, Scottsdale, Queen Creek.You know, it's just it's enabled us to expand as well in those areas.So, They're coming from all over the place in the Valley.It's not just Phoenix.I saw Tucson was pretty high on that list too, right?They are, yes.Tucson has actually been a surprising one. this year they crept up and a lot is going into Tucson.Wow.Whitney Beal is our guest with U-Haul Company of Metro Phoenix.We're talking the mid-year migration trend, a glimpse at where our one-way customers are coming from in 2024.Do you guys also track where they're going to?You know what I mean?Because there are people that do actually leave Arizona, believe it or not.We do, yeah.We do track that.I mean, we can track where any truck goes and where it's coming from. I don't have those specifics, but we can track, yeah, we can track everything.Yeah.So the idea behind this is kind of give us an idea of where our new neighbors might be from, right?That's correct.Yeah.So this is, do you guys do this every year?Kind of a mid-year migration trend?Yeah, you do.And has California been number one for like 10 years running?Pretty much, yeah.I remember I've been in this position almost eight years, and I remember about six years ago, We were also top migration trend in the country, and on that list was California as well.Yeah, that makes sense 100%.Tell me a little bit about U-Haul, what you guys are doing these days.Obviously, I think we've all used U-Haul numerous times in our lives, whether it's to rent a trailer to move something or you need the big truck and you're moving cross-country or whatever it might be or moving a home.Give me some good stuff with U-Haul right now. Yeah, no, for sure.I mean, obviously, with the influx of people coming in, it's really enabled us to expand our business features and operations.We've actually opened, in the last year, a total of four new stores here in the Metro Valley.You know, we have Apache Junction, Surprise, Levine, and Queen Creek, and we have a few more coming on board.We got a very large operation coming on board here in Scottsdale, Arizona, with... over 1,500 storage units.A lot of people don't know this, but we do portable storage as well.So we have a 2,500 box warehouse opening up.So we have a lot of good things happening right now in the Metro.We currently have a really nice app to use.So if anyone is moving, I highly encourage them to download the app.It makes your moving experience a little bit more personable to you and you can track a lot of it and do a lot of it just right there on your mobile device.So A lot of good things are happening right now.All right.And if someone wanted to read this entire migration trend, is that up online right now?I believe so.Yeah.Oh, I think it's right here.MyUHallHistory.com.Okay, perfect.Whitney Beal with U-Haul.Thank you, Whitney.I appreciate your time, and we'll catch up down the road. Sounds good.Thank you.Thank you.Whitney Beal with U-Haul Company Metro Phoenix.They're all coming.They're all coming.So one of the other things, I didn't want to get into this, but let's see.So it says top origin metro areas for arriving U-Haul customers outside of Arizona.Los Angeles, California, one.Las Vegas, Nevada, two.Denver, Colorado, three.Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas, four.Albuquerque, five.Portland, six.El Paso, Texas, seven. Houston, 8.Bay Area, San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, 9.And then San Diego, 10.I would never leave San Diego.I wouldn't either, actually.San Diego's the one I can deal with.Unless it's getting overrun with.Well, it is, and it's still, you know, but San Diego's pretty nice.It is pretty nice.Is that your destination?No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.Where would you live?You could just pick anywhere in the continental U.S., Oh, I was going to say Italy.Okay.So little Italy in New York.No, Italy.No, I mean, as we continue on with our travels, we're going to spend more time back east.Yeah?Are you going to move back east?No, like, you know, just do the road trip.Not move.I would just rent.You're saying if I would be done... Yeah, if you were going to move, retire.I'll tell you what, that Truckee, California was pretty nice.Not going to lie to you, man.Perfect weather.Yeah.But that's a summer thing.You don't want to live in Tahoe in the winter.No, no.Unless you ski.Yeah, I could see you on some snow.Nope, I don't ski.You could snowboard.I don't.I've snowboarded.I'm not good at either.That's because you don't practice.I don't do things I'm not good at.Well, I do this radio show.All right, I said the joke for you.I need two callers, James.Yeah, you do.

This message is brought to you by ADOT, the ABA, and this station.And now, on Money Radio's Business for Breakfast show, it's time for the business of sports. Time for a little BOS on this very busy Thursday morning.The business of sports.All right, where do we start?How about this?We'll go to the NBA.Gordon Hayward.This is making me feel old.Gordon Hayward just retired from the NBA.He announced it on social media.Today, I'm officially retiring from the game of basketball.It's been an incredible ride. So grateful to everyone who helped me achieve more than I ever would imagine.Hayward, the ninth overall pick of the Utah Jazz, was an all-star, a few other things.He had a bad leg injury in one of his first games in Boston.He played at Butler.You remember that?Because remember, they almost beat Duke in the championship game.He had a mid-court shot. That he let fly, and if it went in, they would have beat Duke.And Butler was like the 10 or the 11 seed.They were a low seed.They were one of the lowest to ever go into the championship game.And this shot hit the backboard, hit the rim, and lipped out.It was one of the great games I can remember in a long time in NCAA championship history. But the thing that's got me feeling old is Gordon Hayward retired after 14 seasons in the NBA.I was like, what?Wow.I didn't think like – I feel like Gordon Hayward just had Duke.I feel like that game was just the other – 14 years.He was drafted in the 2010 draft, so he is going to step away.He was a good player.He had a good career.Probably didn't live up to all the hype, but he was still pretty good.He got paid too, by the way.He got paid.The Sunday ticket – A whole fiasco thing, right?Do you have your Sunday ticket?Yeah.Oh, yeah.Yeah, me too.I paid for it this year.Yeah?I'm not sure I'm going to utilize it, but I paid for it.Well, you're a sports guy, so I could see you.You know, it's kind of cool.The thing I liked about it, like say Green Bay has the late game.You could flip over and see what Chicago and Minnesota are doing or Detroit.You know what I mean?I don't know.I like it.I just wish they would do an a la carte thing where I could just watch Packers. We've talked about that.If you could just pick one.I just want to pay for one team.How much is one team?$100.Okay.Boom.That's all you get, though.Give me the pregame stuff, the postgame stuff.It does make sense.By the way, what I was trying to say, but my story just went away.What's going on? NFL Sunday ticket judge jury didn't follow instructions.The judge who presided over the class action lawsuit filed by Sunday ticket subscribers against the NFL said the jury did not follow his instructions in determining damages.U.S.District Judge Philip Gutierrez made the remark as the. As he heard the NFL's post-trial motion asking they rule for the league if he finds the plaintiffs did not prove their case.Gutierrez could order a new trial because the eight-person jury came up with its own calculations for damages.There isn't a timeline for when Gutierrez could rule on the motion, but yeah. The federal jury awarded $4.7 billion in damages to residential and commercial subscribers after it ruled the NFL violated antitrust laws in disturbing out-of-market Sunday afternoon games on a premium subscription service.The lawsuit covered 2.5 million residential subscribers.Probably you.You were probably one of them. I hope so.Jury of five men and three women found the NFL liable for $4,610,300,000.And then also to $96 billion in damages to the commercial class. And the jury's amount did not conform to the college football model by Daniel Rasher, an economist at the University of San Francisco, or multiple distributor models by John Zona, who was an expert witness.So they had these, like, models they were supposed to follow, and the jury just, like, came up with their own options. Well, the only reason I had DirecTV was for the Sunday ticket.Yeah.A lot of people did, yeah.Being a Packers fan, unless they had really good games, a really good season, and then I'd watch three games on Sunday ticket and the rest were on primetime.Yeah.This is not sports, by the way.I don't really have any Olympic updates, but this is just memorabilia, right?Okay.So two auctions that took place recently.Neither of them have anything to do with sports. The outfit worn by Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone.Remember the green pants, red sweater, and he had the guns and all that?Or not guns, but he had the whatever.He had his holster.$47,500 that sold for.If that was a little out of your price range, James, what you could have bought at auction was only $4,248.It was a... antidepressant pill bottle labeled to Elvis Presley.That'd be cool to have.Yeah.I'm sorry, but that'd be cool.Elvis Presley Truville 225.Take one tablet daily.Dr. Nicopulos.Is that the one that went to jail?I don't know.It's got the phone number on it.It's got the number.It's got the date.Yeah, so... That'd be cool to own something that Elvis owned, you know?Yeah.I mean, it's an antidepressant bottle, but sure.All right, that's the business of sports time now for this.Why did he have to be depressed? The morning lineup continues right here on Money Radio.And don't forget, every day following Business for Breakfast, our buddy Steve Jurich, host of Mastering Money, comes on.He calls it the Common Sense Financial Hour.Of course, that show is heard every day, 8 a.m.and 11 a.m.right here on Money Radio.Right now, we're going to check in with Steve, see what's going on for his daily update.What's up, Steve?Hey, Mark.How are you doing? Investing for retirement, you're likely to hear a lot of well-meaning guidance from family, friends, and others.As you weigh the potential benefits of well-meaning advice from non-professionals or you review commonly cited investment rules, consider that most are designed for that average situation, which means they may be wrong as often as they're right. That's actually the definition of average.Two rules, though, are very helpful when planning for retirement, the rule of 100 and the rule of 72.The rule of 100 is all about allocation, risk tolerance, and time horizon.How much of your money should be kept safe and how much at risk, do you know?Well, the rule of 100 is a good starting point.Take your age, subtract it from the number 100.The remaining number is the maximum percent that a conservative or moderate investor can should keep at risk in the market.If you're aggressive, a little bit more.It's not set in stone, but it will help you grow your nest egg over time and keep things much better organized.And the fact is, you need to have a good portion of your money safe these days, out of harm's way, and producing spendable income throughout your retirement.The rule of 72 is different.It's an infallible rule of mathematics. Take the rate of return you're getting on an investment.Divide that rate into the number 72.The result is how long it will take to double your money at that rate of return.If you're making 8%, your money will double in nine years.That's how annuity income riders work.They may grow your income capital on a guaranteed basis at 8% guaranteed, even if the market is falling by 50%.Your income is safe, secure, and pays you for a lifetime guaranteed. With the IQL Smarter Bucketing System, you will have both rules working for you at one time in a clear written financial plan.You will have a strategy for growing your nest egg systematically over the long run in one bucket while being paid a secure, reliable income for life up from 5% to 12% or more depending on age and deferral period in a clearly defined and separate income bucket.Fixed income and cash, very important part of your retirement plan. Don't overlook it.Our bucketing system installs a firewall between your lifetime income capital and your growth capital.Rates are high in annuities right now.You may hate yourself later if you don't do an annuity now.Let's get together soon in Scottsdale.

The restaurant chain knows this means offering value.People will not come back if they didn't get what they wanted.They're just looking for a fair price, not always a discounted price.But rather than cutting prices or offering value meals, as some restaurant chains are doing, Red Robin is counting on its menu with both higher end and budget friendly prices and the allure of bottomless menu items diners have more than thirty unlimited offerings to choose from ranging from garlic fries to steamed broccoli salad cream soda and various lemonade flavors Seven days a week, 365 days a year, you can get all these items as much as you want.That according to Chief Financial Officer Todd Wilson.Quote, but we're not necessarily intending to go to the deep discounting model that some of our competitors have done or that Red Robin has done in the past, he said.Restaurants generally have struggled in recent years to keep diners as first the pandemic and then the economy diminished considerably. customers' willingness to eat out.For Red Robin, foot traffic also dropped because menu items quickly and quality, of course, fell off.As former executives looked to bring costs down and just cut costs any way they could, they cut quality as well.The chain's customer traffic numbers have largely been down over the last nine quarters. Guest traffic was down 9.4% for the quarter ended April 21st of 24, compared with a year earlier when deep discounting boosted traffic while hitting profits. With new leadership, including a new CEO who stepped in nearly two years ago, Red Robin has been working to improve that quality and profitability and simply bring diners back inside the stores.The company is cutting out costs where possible, mostly related to Red Robin's supply chain, Wilson said.Take hamburger patties, which used to be delivered in 10-pound cases, each with a delivery fee.Those are now 20-pound cases, or twice as much product for one fee, the CFO said.That might sound really simple, but that change is worth a couple million bucks by itself, Williams said.Red Robin cut roughly $5 million in costs in three months and on April 21st, a figure expected to reach around $19 million in 2024. meanwhile there are more workers including bussers bartenders and hosts meant to improve diners service red robin and may also revamped its loyalty program and in march kicked off a three million dollar marketing campaign promoting the bottomless menu items Customers know Red Robin has endless fries, according to Wilson.The marketing push is meant to also introduce them to other options, such as bottomless coleslaw, soft drinks, and macaroni and cheese for kids, which Wilson said is one way Red Robin is offering value to stretched consumers rather than discounting burgers or other menu items. The breadth of the bottomless menu has been a topic of discussion with investors who wonder if it is a drag on Red Robin's financials, Wilson said.That effect isn't showing up so far, but the CFO said the chain's primary focus is boosting traffic, even if it means giving up some margin.We're more than willing to take that tradeoff of perhaps giving up a little bit of margin per guest. to get more guests in the door early signals suggest the changes are resonating with diners comparable restaurant revenue which looks at company-owned restaurants open for 18 months increased a full three-tenths of one percent in just the first five weeks of red robin's second quarter compared with the same weeks in 2023 a challenge in drawing customers right now it is that diners generally have been pulling back on eating out as they look to stretch their dollars in this Biden inflation.Overall guest traffic at sit-down eateries was down 4% in the three months ended in June compared with the year-ago period, according to research firm Black Box Intelligence.It was down 1.9% in fast food and fast casual restaurants, the data show. Other restaurant chains have endless offerings, but it tends to be one or a handful rather than north of 30, Endless said.Buffalo Wild Wings this year announced an all-you-can-eat boneless wings and fries deal, available twice weekly for $19.99, and Darden Restaurant's own Olive Garden has long provided never-ending soup or salad and breadsticks to in-restaurant diners who order an entree. Unlimited menu items don't always work, though.Red Lobster, the largest seafood restaurant chain in the U.S., filed for bankruptcy in May after failing to recover from waning traffic suffered during the pandemic as menu prices crept higher.The chain's all-you-can-eat shrimp deal was the knockout punch contributed to big losses.But analysts said Red Robin's bottled the sides and drinks apart from an unlimited protein option.Diners may only order those protein offerings, and they may opt for numerous refills, said Todd Brooks, a managing director at Benchmark, less likely is a customer who only orders broccoli or fries.So you don't really get soaked by offering it, according to Brooks, but it gives the perception that I can have as much as I want, which the consumer puts a lot of value on, end quote.And when you retire... you will put a value on having all the income you want without interruption.All you can eat food may not even be that healthy for you, but all you can spend income, well, that can make retired life a whole lot better.At IQ Wealth, we help you manage your money so you can pursue your goals.

Considering an annuity, your timing could be very good.Because of the sudden fast rise in interest rates, insurance companies can now offer the best annuity rates I've seen in a decade.These rates may not last, so you're wise to compare right now.For example, a 5% interest rate is available on many annuities, and income bonuses of 20, 25, and 30% are available on select uncapped next-generation annuities.But be careful. Don't let a pitchman make you think you are getting a principal bonus.You're not.No one is giving money away.The bonus is real, but it's on your income benefit, not principal.That can be a good thing, but the income is coming from your principal.An income that is too high can deplete your principal faster.

Steve Jurich here.There are four kinds of annuities, immediate, variable, fixed, and fixed index.With immediate annuities, you give up control of your money and the insurance company keeps it when you die.With variable annuities, you hand over 3% to 4% every year to the insurance company, making it a lousy investment.Fixed annuities are only paying 2%.Fixed index is the only category where you can grow capital without losing while simultaneously building a future pension-like income. with low or no fees.In other words, rather than risking a loss in bond funds, you're adding a pension dimension to your financial plan without giving up control of your lump sum.At IQ Wealth, we review up to 1,200 annuities for you.We're not out to win sales awards.We're out to win your trust and help you get there from here.

Listen to The Ben Shapiro Show every Monday through Friday, right here on Money Radio, 1510 AM and 105.3 FM.Now, back to Mastering Money with Steve Jurich.Welcome back to the Common Sense Financial Hour, where financial success is not only possible, but highly attainable.I'm Steve Jurich.It's time now for the Mastering Money Market Intel segment.For those who saw the demonstrations inside Apple offices, is their big meeting talking about what they're going to be doing in the next decade.They saw a preview of a revamped Siri offering a showcase of amazing capabilities, you know, as you can get from a powerful AI voice assistant.The famed assistant, one of the last projects Apple co-founder Steve Jobs worked on before his death, has been given a total overhaul. Capable of running on an iPhone and without an internet connection, the new Siri impressed people with its improved speed, conversational capabilities, and the accuracy with which it understood user commands.Codenamed Project Blackbird, the effort also imagined a Siri with capabilities built by third-party app developers, according to people familiar with the work.Yet a competing project won out in an internal contest ahead of the 10-year anniversary of Siri's launch.Known as Siri X, the more modest upgrade involved moving more Siri software onto iPhones from remote servers to improve the voice assistant's speed and privacy.The Siri X enhancement was unveiled in 2021. At Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference, the company is setting out to join an AI arms race that many think will define the future of technology.The iPhone maker is trying to catch up with Microsoft, Alphabet, Google, and other rivals that have begun to integrate generative AI into their core products.Apple's caution and characteristic secrecy as well as the care it takes in upgrading devices where hardware and software are seamlessly integrated, have hobbled its early efforts in the AI area It now finds itself in the unusual position of having to take risks.It doesn't like to do that.Playing catch-up.The company is set to announce an array of generative AI upgrades to its software products, including Siri.And we'll see where that goes.While Apple isn't expected to catch up with leading AI innovators soon, the company is preparing to unveil AI features with impressive capabilities. that also maximize privacy for users.Now, that is a very big deal, a concern that will be central to unlocking the full potential of AI assistance.It's a scary thing if it ain't private. Apple is also expected to unveil one or more potential partnerships with major AI developers after holding talks with OpenAI, Google, and Cohere.Apple has long prided itself on perfection in its product rollouts, a near impossibility with emerging AI models. While open AI systems have dazzled more than 180 million users now with their generation of writing, images, and video, they are prone to occasional errors, often called hallucinations.Apple has had limited tolerance for those issues.There's no such thing as 100% accuracy with AI. That's the fundamental reality that, according to Pedro Domingos, a professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, quote, Apple is not compatible with that.They won't release something until it's perfect.Google, Microsoft, and Samsung Electronics have begun rapidly integrating generative AI into their devices and services, while Apple finds itself behind in a generational shift taking place in the tech industry.Many investors and AI experts have said the company will find a way to bring generative AI to the masses and get right in the race for the lead in it.As a matter of fact, over the years, Apple has made improvements to Siri and incorporated smaller AI features throughout all of its products.In the recently released headset Vision Pro, AI is extensively used for tracking eyes and hand positions.When Siri launched in 2011, Apple was ahead of rivals in seeking to establish the first AI assistant.Jobs, who spearheaded the acquisition of 2010 that led to Siri, encouraged the team to keep the assistants' dry wit and sense of humor.She does have that, I guess.The early launch demonstrated the company's willingness to take risks.I do find myself arguing with Siri from time to time.Siri was the last thing Apple was first on, said Diago Kittloss, co-founder of the Siri startup that Apple bought. who left Apple soon after the product's launch.As Apple struggled to keep advancing Siri, the company hired one of Google's top engineering executives to run its AI strategy.That would be John Giandrea.In 2018, he was elevated to the role of senior vice president, reporting directly to Apple chief executive Tim Cook. In early meetings, Giandrea made it clear that improving Siri was a main focus.He was also tasked with centralizing much of Apple's fragmented efforts regarding AI.He began building up his AI team by recruiting Google employees through startup acquisitions, but his team had difficulty fitting in with the rest of Apple, according to people familiar with their work.There was a cultural resistance.The new AI group operated much like parts of Google, where deadlines are more loosely defined.Teams inside Apple need to maintain rigorous deadlines to have products ready for release every fall.Efforts to collaborate between other parts of Apple that were building products and the AI team at times fell apart because they could not agree on deadlines, nothing else, just a deadline.So Apple has stepped up efforts to build its own internal generative AI, not relying on a third party. In February, the company canceled its decades-long effort to build its own electric car to focus simply on generative AI.Some of the employees have been redeployed.Insiders are saying this year could be an important one for Siri.Kitlaw said, I absolutely see a renaissance coming.Well, we shall see.Perhaps the stock market will take a second bite of the apple. which you'll also see about that.When it comes to retirement, you can't just ask Siri for peace of mind.You need to know your income will exceed your outgo from now on, no matter what.And you need to know that, not hope it works.And you might not even be aware you're hoping it works.If your plan is to simply take money out of the stock market as it rides up and down, or take money out at these high interest rates, and all of a sudden those rates drop back down to two or three, Well, you don't have a plan.Let's get together and we can talk about that.At IQ Wealth, we help you manage your money so you can pursue your goals.We're coming right back and talking about what your parents helped you with.

Now, you kids are probably saying to yourselves, hey, I'm going to go out and I'm going to get the world by the tail and wrap it around and pull it down and put it in my pocket.Well, I'm here to tell you that you're probably going to find out as you go out there that you're not going to amount to jack squat. He's Arizona's money guy, best-selling author, financial advisor, and Kiplinger contributor, Steve Jurich.Let Steve show you how to plan, invest, insure, retire, and stay retired.Now, here's Steve. Welcome back to Mastering Money, the home of high IQ retirement planning.If you can't listen to our entire program live today, where you can listen any time of the day or night on your smartphone or computer, just download the free Mastering Money app or go to RetirementRadioUSA.com, where you can find all of our podcasts.Mastering Money is brought to you twice daily by IQ Wealth Management in Scottsdale, an independent registered investment advisor. with asset custodian Fidelity Institutional member SIPC.With IQ Wealth, Fidelity is your broker.We can also work with Schwab.Our team is your advisor.It's not mutual funds we do.We have private portfolios held at major custodians like Fidelity and Schwab.Our firm is part of an integrated, world-class financial network partnering with a Sub-advisory agreement, that would be AE Wealth Management.They are our sub-advisor, and they do the grunt work, if you will, behind the scenes.They're on the job right now.We also work with Nationwide Financial and Lincoln Financial on Securities. all SEC registered investment advisors with way over $60 billion under management combined, but with organized teams on the job, teams of professionals, and teamwork does make the dream work.We are the exclusive providers. of the Black Diamond Dividend Growth and Blue Diamond Technology Leaders Portfolios, as well as the Black Diamond MAG7 Dividend, which combines about 70% high-quality dividend stocks with about 30% of the high-quality momentum tech.We're overweight on NVIDIA and a few other names and working out pretty well.It's time now for the Mastering Money Q&A session. question is, are your parents to blame for the way you handle money, or do they get the credit for the way you do it?Maybe, maybe not, according to many experts.Whether we realize it or not, how we were raised has a tremendous impact on how we make decisions as adults.Sometimes the results are positive, not always.Other times the results are detrimental to our well-being, especially when it comes to our financial health.This doesn't mean that we can just blame a mom or dad or both for our money mistakes and leave it at that.We want to take the next step.We want to understand the root of our bad habits and make a conscious effort to change that.Here are some common parenting behaviors that can negatively influence your money habits and what you can do to overcome that.Number one, your parents spoiled you.Now, that's not true for most of you listening to me right now, but true for some.I've met people, they admit it, you know, and you may have done it to your kids without knowing it at the time, or your grandkids are having it happen to them. Right now, the behavior is that perhaps your parents were deprived as children themselves, and in response, they chose to overspend on you.They wanted to make your life better than theirs.You might do that to your own kids.As I said, your kids might be doing it to your grandkids.You grew up living a life of abundance and not wanting for anything if this happened to you. The influence is you feel entitled to a luxurious lifestyle.You don't know anything else.Maybe your kids feel that same way as adults.Kids who are spoiled can often grow up to expect that they can and should still have whatever they want.Do we have a spoiled society?Sort of.I mean, everybody wants to be a rich rock star or athlete. The problem is they might not have the income to support the ability to live large.That's why they may lean on you again.That's what can happen.And it also can lead to unnecessary debt when they don't have anything else to lean on.It's kind of going around these days.The solution, someone has to see the light.A shift in the sense of entitlement from having a lot of stuff to having financial freedom Someone needs to shift that focus.If it's you, okay.But most of the people I'm talking to right now have already planned on having a different type of retirement.They've been savers, and here they are.But we've got kids coming up.That's going to affect the overall economy, and that's why it's important even to you.If you are a big-time saver, this is what's going to affect your outcomes in the stock market, et cetera. If you're still a ways from retirement, you know that the recommendation is to challenge yourself to see what it's like to live modestly and then put any savings toward more important goals like buying a home, a comfortable retirement or starting a family.All these things are pretty tough under Bidenomics.Buying a home is just becoming out of reach for many young people. Many of them feel like they will never see Social Security, and when you let 10 million new people in that suddenly are going to want free health care, they're going to be demanding to be on Social Security roles, they're all going to have kids, and those kids will have kids.This 10 million person invasion will turn into 30 million, and you are going to have a strain on Social Security like you wouldn't believe. Now, the fact of the matter is, if you're already retired, you want to shift your investment focus then from trying to make the big score in stocks and always trying to beat the S&P 500 like you did when you were younger to securing. a strong, lasting income in excess of your living and lifestyle expenses.Hey, you're going to be dead in 50 years.So enjoy your life to the hilt, yes.And don't cheat yourself.You know, you still want to – you don't want to have a beer taste with a champagne income.You can do the other way around when you're retired if – You have the income coming in.That income is guaranteed, guaranteed to never quit and guaranteed to take care of both you and your spouse for as long as you live.And when you do that, by the way, you'll end up leaving more to your kids.The annuity principle might wind down if you're taking it out at a clip of 9% income for life. and the principal is making four or five, well, you might shave down your principal there, but every dollar you get from an annuity is a dollar you do not have to take out from another account.That's called the bucketing strategy.Now, let's move on.Let's say your parents were quite charitable.Well, perhaps they grew up poor or experienced some kind of trauma firsthand.In response, they chose to invest their time and money in causes that they were passionate about.That's a beautiful thing. The influence is that your heart is in the right place and so are your parents, but you may give more money away that you don't have.And whether you feel obligated because of your parents' experience or want to match their generosity, you can't seem to say no to most charitable appeals.Charity is a wonderful and noble concept, but it is easy to let your emotions get the best of you and put you in a very bad financial spot.Many people... Oh, I go to a big church, and there are many people, they shouldn't be giving as much as they're giving.You want to tithe, yes. But charity does begin at home.If you become a mess financially, it doesn't help.You can't, you know, this idea that if you give more to the church, God will give you money.We have some TV evangelists in San Antonio that like to talk like that.It doesn't work that way.You have to be smart with your money.Now, your parents may never have taught you about money.This is a very common problem, often due to the subconscious perpetuation of their own parents' lack of financial education. Yeah, it can be passed down.I'm on the air, but both my mom and dad were not stock market investors at all.I don't come from big money.I'm working class, parents, and the bottom line is my mom was a big-time saver, but she was more of a risk-taker.She was an entrepreneur, but she wouldn't put a penny in the stock market. My dad either.He was a pension guy.So that's where you hear me.My influence is coming out.I believe in both.I believe in having a pension where I don't have to worry and you can't screw things up with a bigger part of your money and then taking some risks, well thought out, metrically determined risk with part of your money in a separate bucket. There are different animals, income investments and growth investments.You want to keep the animal known as a growth investment in a cage in your retirement, a separate cage, and that would be your growth bucket.Now, all this might mean that you're money foolish or someone you know is money foolish, and probably in a variety of ways.Someone can be who is influenced that way, never taught about what can happen and what can go wrong with money, You're not going to fix them now.I'm sorry.If you wait until they're in their 30s or 40s and 50s, it's a problem.They could just be overspending, undersaving, or avoiding investing as a problem.I mean, many people say, well, I'm not going to invest a penny in the market.Well, if you said that in 2008, you missed out so far now on a 500% increase since the bottom in 2008.So what's the solution?Get educated. Being a Mastering Money listener, I humbly say, is a great start.I'm here to try to give you all the facts and details and real brutally honest things about what's going to happen.I try to see over hills and around corners for my clients.When you stop and think about it, a lot can go wrong in the future.You can just say, ah, Social Security's going to be fine.They always say this.Well, they always?What are you talking about? I think we're in a totally different environment.More people than ever.You're going to have generative AI taking over.They are not going to be – I did a little research.These robots, they don't pay much in the way of FICO.So as they take jobs over, you may not have as much money coming into Social Security. So you want to invest differently.Start thinking about having a tremendous fixed income base.And then you invest the rest with purpose.But there's other things you can do.You know, start learning.You've got to be careful what you learn.You go to some of these mutual fund sites.They think it's all mutual funds.Go to Vanguard.Go to Yahoo and look up Vanguard Total Bond and its performance over the last one year, three years, five years, and ten years. It's a red downward chart towards Florida.It's not heading towards Maine.It's not going up.It's going down.And if you call that fixed income, you're going to be really wondering what the heck hit you.Now, maybe your parents lived large. You know, the fact is they were maybe they were compensating for being deprived as kids themselves or they felt the need to keep up with the Joneses.Whatever the reason, as we said, your parents spoiled themselves and probably spent more than they should.You may live beyond your means, too, and not sure why you're even doing it. You aren't even aware that you are doing it.As much as we try to avoid turning into our parents, well, that's what usually happens.There's this old saying, at birth, you look like your parents.At death, you look like your choices.Growing up in a home where your role models lived a lavish lifestyle would make it particularly challenging for you to adopt a modest one.Now, I don't want you to sit there and say, well, that's not me.That's not the point.Any of these things could be you. But the idea is you are now planning a whole different phase of your life.Leave the accumulation phase, leaving it, the contribution and accumulation phase.You are entering the distribution phase, and it is a whole different ballgame. Well, profitable investing involves practical thinking, knowledge of the economy, and the ability to process data.But do you really want to process data for a living when you retire?Investing in quality and allocating properly, that's how you endure the ups and downs in retirement. and never miss an income payment.You want to pay yourself now.You've worked your whole life, but pay yourself enough to have the time of your life.At IQ Wealth, we built a business model to help our clients invest more intelligently while preserving capital, maintaining ample liquidity, and enjoying safe, secure income they can never outlive.

In 2024, the Black Diamond dividend growth portfolio finished the first quarter of 2024 up nearly 7%.That's quite a pace for dividend stocks.If you are looking for investments that pay you in hard cash to own them every 90 days, The black diamond from IQ Wealth held at Fidelity is exactly that.It is a rules-based, math-based portfolio, meaning we can't just buy any stock.We have rules.That focuses on the stocks of profitable companies that increase their dividends. every single year and we aim to buy companies that keep on increasing their earnings every year it's not a trading account it's an investment account yes we do replace stocks from time to time put them over on the watch list but our goal is to find those steady eddy companies paying great dividends that go up every year and get paid every 90 days.We require 10 consecutive years of dividend increases for a stock to even be considered or selected for the portfolio and any stock that does not raise its dividend is eliminated.We require an investment grade credit rating.Yeah, it matters. The Black Diamond is not a mutual fund, so you can't look it up on Fidelity.That's where it is, though.We have it at Schwab as well.It is a private, professionally managed dividend growth portfolio intentionally focused on high-quality companies making real money in the real economy who dominate their industry.The Black Diamond dividend growth portfolio has proven its resilience over the years.The portfolio was up 20.7% per Fidelity in 2021. When the S&P 500 fell by 20%, fell by 20%, the S&P did, in 2022, Black Diamond was only down about 5%.The good news, new quarterly dividends, though, were on the way after the new year and bought more shares at a 5% discount.Every 90 days, like clockwork, you get your dividends.If the market is down, you're buying more shares than ever with those dividends that rise every year. The black diamond can be thought of as an all-weather portfolio because of that.You know, think about it.If your stocks were herds of cattle, they would keep having babies, and eventually your babies start having babies. That's the long-term strategy of the IQ Wealth Black Diamond Dividend Growth Portfolio.You retire only once, but retirement strategist Steve Jurich and his team at IQ Wealth Management help people retire every day.Whether you're retiring early, late, or on time, you want a plan that is clear, easy to understand, and within IRS rules.You want truly effective strategies based on common sense solutions that are proven, designed by an experienced fiduciary with your best interest in mind.
